## Profile Entity

### New Properties (Onboarding Redesign)

| Property | Type | Default | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|

## Application Entity

Tier application entity with state machine workflow. Used for Colaborador and Asociado applications (never Volunteer). During initial signup, created inline alongside the profile. After onboarding, created via the dedicated Application route.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Id | Guid | Primary key |
| UserId | Guid | FK to User |
| MembershipTier | MembershipTier | Tier being applied for (Colaborador or Asociado) |
| Status | ApplicationStatus | Current state (Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Withdrawn) |
| Motivation | string (4000) | Required motivation statement |
| AdditionalInfo | string? (4000) | Optional additional information |
| Language | string? (10) | UI language at submission (ISO 639-1 code) |
| SubmittedAt | Instant | When submitted |
| UpdatedAt | Instant | Last update |
| ResolvedAt | Instant? | When resolved (approved/rejected/withdrawn) |
| ReviewedByUserId | Guid? | Reviewer ID |

| DecisionNote | string? (4000) | Board's collective decision note (only record after vote deletion) |
| RenewalReminderSentAt | Instant? | When renewal reminder was last sent |

### Navigation Properties

- `User` — applicant
- `ReviewedByUser` — reviewer
- `StateHistory` — ApplicationStateHistory collection
- `BoardVotes` — BoardVote collection (transient, empty after finalization)

## BoardVote Entity

Individual Board member's vote on a tier application. **Transient working data** — records are deleted when the application is finalized (GDPR data minimization). Only the collective decision (Application.DecisionNote, BoardMeetingDate) is retained.

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Id | Guid | Primary key |
| ApplicationId | Guid | FK to Application |
| BoardMemberUserId | Guid | FK to User (Board member) |
| Vote | VoteChoice | The vote choice |
| Note | string? (4000) | Optional note explaining the vote |
| VotedAt | Instant | When the vote was first cast |
| UpdatedAt | Instant? | When the vote was last updated |

**Constraint:** Unique `(ApplicationId, BoardMemberUserId)` — one vote per Board member per application.

## Constants

### RoleNames

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Admin | "Admin" | Full system access |
| Board | "Board" | Elevated permissions, votes on tier applications |
| ConsentCoordinator | "ConsentCoordinator" | Safety gate for onboarding consent checks |
| VolunteerCoordinator | "VolunteerCoordinator" | Facilitation contact for onboarding |

### SystemTeamIds

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Volunteers | `00000000-0000-0000-0001-000000000001` | All active volunteers |
| Leads | `00000000-0000-0000-0001-000000000002` | All team leads |

| Colaboradors | `00000000-0000-0000-0001-000000000005` | Approved Colaboradors |

## ContactField Entity

Contact fields allow members to share different types of contact information with per-field visibility controls.

### Field Types (`ContactFieldType`)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ~~Email~~ | **Deprecated** — use `UserEmail` entity instead. Kept for backward compatibility. |
| Phone | Phone number |
| Signal | Signal messenger |
| Telegram | Telegram messenger |
| WhatsApp | WhatsApp messenger |
| Discord | Discord username |
| Other | Custom type (requires CustomLabel) |

### Visibility Levels (`ContactFieldVisibility`)

Lower values are more restrictive. A viewer with access level X can see fields with visibility >= X.

| Value | Level | Who Can See |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| BoardOnly | 0 | Board members only |
| LeadsAndBoard | 1 | Team leads and board |
| MyTeams | 2 | Members who share a team with the owner |
| AllActiveProfiles | 3 | All active members |

### Access Level Logic

Viewer access is determined by:
1. **Self** → BoardOnly (sees everything)
2. **Board member** → BoardOnly (sees everything)
3. **Any lead** → LeadsAndBoard
4. **Shares team with owner** → MyTeams
5. **Active member** → AllActiveProfiles only

## Term Lifecycle

Colaborador and Asociado memberships have 2-year synchronized terms expiring Dec 31 of **odd years** (2027, 2029, 2031...). The `TermExpiryCalculator.ComputeTermExpiry()` method computes the expiry as the next Dec 31 of an odd year that is at least 2 years from the approval date.

- On approval: `Application.TermExpiresAt` is set
- On expiry without renewal: user reverts to Volunteer tier, removed from Colaboradors/Asociados team
- Renewal: new Application entity (same tier), goes through normal Board voting
- Reminder: `TermRenewalReminderJob` sends reminders 90 days before expiry

## Serialization Notes

- All entities use System.Text.Json serialization
- See `CODING_RULES.md` for serialization requirements
