# Tech Debt Task Backlog — Claude Autonomous Prompt

## Mission

You are executing specific, pre-identified tech debt tasks from the backlog below. Work through them in order of priority. After completing each task, mark it done in this section of your handoff notes. Prefer changes that delete, consolidate, or reuse existing surface; do not create a new abstraction unless it clearly reduces net complexity.

**Work autonomously.** Pick the next uncompleted task, implement it, verify the build passes, commit, push, move on. If a task would add new durable surface instead of consolidating existing surface, document why in the commit/PR before proceeding.

---

## Architecture (4 layers)

```
src/Humans.Domain/          — Entities, enums, value objects (pure, no dependencies)
src/Humans.Application/     — Interfaces, DTOs, constants (business rules)
src/Humans.Infrastructure/  — EF Core, external services, Hangfire jobs
src/Humans.Web/             — Controllers, Razor views, authorization, tag helpers
tests/Humans.Application.Tests/ — Unit tests
```

---

## EXCLUSION ZONES — DO NOT TOUCH

```
src/Humans.Infrastructure/Data/HumansDbContext.cs
src/Humans.Infrastructure/Data/EntityConfigurations/**
src/Humans.Infrastructure/Migrations/**
```

Also do not modify:
- **Entity classes** in `src/Humans.Domain/Entities/`
- **JSON serialization attributes**
- **Migration files**
- **ConsentRecord** — append-only table
- **Existing test files** in `tests/` — don't modify, may add new ones

---

## CODING RULES

1. **NodaTime for all dates/times** — `Instant`, `LocalDate`, `ZonedDateTime`. Never `DateTime`.
2. **Explicit StringComparison** — on all string methods.
3. **No enum comparison operators in LINQ-to-SQL** — use `.Contains()`.
4. **Magic string avoidance** — `nameof()`, `RoleNames.*`, constants.
5. **Font Awesome 6 only** — `fa-solid fa-*`.
6. **UI terminology** — "humans" not "members"/"volunteers".
7. **No concurrency tokens.**
8. **Every new page needs a nav link.**
9. **Admin pages don't need localization.**
10. **Reuse-first discipline.** Before adding new files, public types, interface methods, service/repository methods, DTOs/view models, helpers, endpoints, dependencies, or DI registrations, audit the existing owner/surface first. See `memory/process/reuse-first-change-discipline.md`.

## Build Command

```
dotnet build Humans.slnx -v q && dotnet test Humans.slnx -v q --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Application"
```

## Task Backlog

Tasks are ordered by priority. Check git log and handoff notes to see which are already done. Mark completed tasks in your handoff notes.

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### T1: Consolidate caching patterns
**Status:** Not started
**What:** 16 files use `IMemoryCache` with three different patterns: `GetOrCreateAsync` (best), direct `Set`/`Get`, and `TryGetValue` + manual set. Standardize on `GetOrCreateAsync` everywhere. Extract cache key strings to a `CacheKeys` static class.
**Where:** Search for `IMemoryCache` usage across `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Services/`

#### T2: Consolidate controller error handling
**Status:** Not started
**What:** Three patterns: try-catch → `TempData["ErrorMessage"]`, try-catch → `ModelState.AddModelError`, no error handling. Standardize on TempData pattern with `SetSuccess`/`SetError` helper methods on `HumansControllerBase`.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Web/Controllers/`

#### T3: Move business logic out of controllers
**Status:** Not started
**What:** Several controllers do LINQ transforms, ViewModel construction, and multi-step mutations inline. These belong in services. Fix the worst offenders first.
**Known offenders:**
- `TicketController` injects `HumansDbContext` directly — all analytics logic is inline
- `HumanController.ProvisionEmail` — 4-step workspace provisioning with ordering constraint
- `ProfileController.Edit` POST — phone validation, burner CV check, tier field validation, image type sniffing
- `CampController.Edit` — name-lock date check is a domain rule bypassing `ICampService`
- Effective-members rollup duplicated in `VolController.DepartmentDetail` and `TeamController.Details`

#### T4: Consolidate authorization patterns
**Status:** Not started
**What:** Three mechanisms used inconsistently: `[Authorize(Roles)]` attributes (best for static), `User.IsInRole()` inline checks, service-level `IsUserBoardMemberAsync` calls. Replace inline checks with attributes where feasible.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Web/Controllers/`

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### T5: Standardize background job patterns
**Status:** Not started
**What:** 14 jobs with no shared interface, inconsistent method names (`ExecuteAsync` vs `RunAsync`), no common logging. Create `IRecurringJob` interface, rename entry points to `ExecuteAsync`, add structured logging at start/end.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Jobs/`

#### T6: Replace inline avatar HTML with ViewComponent
**Status:** Partially done (some replaced in earlier runs)
**What:** `UserAvatar` ViewComponent exists but some views use inline `<img>` tags. Find and replace remaining instances.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Web/Views/`

#### T7: Consolidate badge rendering
**Status:** Not started
**What:** Badge rendering scattered across `_RoleBadge.cshtml`, `_VolunteerProfileBadges.cshtml`, and inline HTML. Consolidate where feasible.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Web/Views/Shared/`

#### T8: Standardize email renderer
**Status:** Partially done (some consolidation in earlier runs)
**What:** `EmailRenderer` has repetitive render methods all following the same pattern. Extract a generic `RenderEmailAsync<TModel>` if a clear template pattern exists.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Services/EmailRenderer.cs`

### LOWER PRIORITY

#### T9: Move shift profile methods from ProfileService
**Status:** Not started (identified in super tier handoff)
**What:** `ProfileService.cs` lines 786-827 has `GetOrCreateShiftProfileAsync`, `UpdateShiftProfileAsync`, `GetShiftProfileAsync` — these operate on `VolunteerEventProfile`, not `Profile`. They belong in `IShiftManagementService` or `IShiftSignupService`.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Services/ProfileService.cs`

#### T10: Move shift-count query from TeamService
**Status:** Not started (identified in super tier handoff)
**What:** `TeamService.cs` `GetAdminTeamListAsync` queries `EventSettings`, `Rotas`, `Shifts`, `ShiftSignups` for pending shift counts — this is shift domain logic in a team service.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Services/TeamService.cs`

#### T11: Remove delegating role-check wrappers from ITeamService
**Status:** Not started (identified in super tier handoff)
**What:** `IsUserAdminAsync`, `IsUserBoardMemberAsync`, `IsUserTeamsAdminAsync` still on `ITeamService` as wrappers after the role-check move to `IRoleAssignmentService`. Long-term: remove from ITeamService and update callers/tests.
**Where:** `src/Humans.Application/Interfaces/ITeamService.cs`

## SAFETY CHECKS

Before every change, verify:

1. **Am I touching an EF entity, migration, or DbContext configuration?** → STOP.
2. **Am I renaming a serialized property?** → STOP.
3. **Am I removing something that looks unused?** → STOP, likely used via reflection.
4. **Am I changing an interface in `Application/`?** → Check all implementations AND callers.
5. **Am I adding durable surface?** → Audit existing owners first; public/interface surface requires Peter approval.
6. **Am I changing authorization?** → Verify exact match.
7. **Does build pass?** → Must pass after every change.
8. **Do tests pass?** → Must pass after every change.
