# Tech Debt Reduction — Claude Autonomous Prompt

## Mission

You are autonomously improving a ~70k-line ASP.NET Core 10 Clean Architecture codebase (membership management for a Spanish nonprofit). It grew quickly and patterns have diverged. Your job is to **find and fix the most impactful tech debt** — duplicated logic, inconsistent patterns, misplaced responsibilities, unnecessary complexity, and unnecessary durable surface.

**You decide what to work on.** Scan the codebase, identify the highest-value improvements, fix them, verify the build passes, commit, and move on. Use your judgement about what matters most. Prefer work that deletes, consolidates, or ratchets existing behavior over work that adds new abstractions.

**Work autonomously.** Do not stop for milestone reports. Find the next opportunity, fix it, verify the build passes, commit, push the branch to `origin`, and move to the next one. If a cleanup/refactor would add more durable surface than it removes, stop unless the value is concrete and documented in the commit/PR.

## PRIORITY FOCUS: §15 Service-Ownership Migration

The codebase is mid-migration to the **§15 Profile Section Pattern** — every service owns its data behind a repository, no cross-service DB access, cross-section reads go through owning-service interfaces. This is the highest-value tech debt in the project right now. **Before picking generic cleanups, check whether a §15 lead is unfinished.**

**Read these first** (they are authoritative and current):
- `docs/architecture/design-rules.md` §2 (Service Ownership), §6 (Nav-Strip), §15 (full pattern), §15i (known current violations list)
- `docs/architecture/tech-debt-2026-04-23.md` — prioritized backlog of §15 leads with file:line citations
- `docs/architecture/service-data-access-map.md` — per-section ownership map

**Highest-value §15 leads (as of 2026-04-23 — verify against current code before acting):**

1. **Repository pattern inconsistency.** 6 repositories still use the old Scoped + `HumansDbContext` shape; 20 use the §15 Singleton + `IDbContextFactory` shape. Flip the stragglers (BudgetRepository, CampaignRepository, FeedbackRepository, RoleAssignmentRepository, ShiftSignupRepository — and leave ApplicationRepository alone if #533's no-decorator decision still stands).
2. **Jobs injecting `HumansDbContext` directly (§2c violations).** `ProcessAccountDeletionsJob`, `ProcessEmailOutboxJob`, `ProcessGoogleSyncOutboxJob`, `SendAdminDailyDigestJob`, `SendBoardDailyDigestJob`, `SendReConsentReminderJob`, `SuspendNonCompliantMembersJob`. Route reads/writes through owning-service interfaces.
3. **Cross-domain nav reads missing `#pragma warning disable CS0618`.** `GoogleWorkspaceSyncService`, `SystemTeamSyncJob`, residual sites in `TeamService`. Either add the pragma + migrate off the nav via an in-memory join, or wrap with the pragma if the nav is still declared.
4. **CalendarService not in the §15i migration list.** `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Services/CalendarService.cs` still lives in Infrastructure and has a cross-domain `.Include(e => e.OwningTeam)`. Needs the full migration (repository + Application-layer move + `ITeamService` stitch for owning-team display).
5. **§15i documentation drift.** `design-rules.md` has stale counts ("~25 services", "14 repositories") — the real numbers are 4 business services and 26 repos. Update if you touch adjacent text.
6. **Cross-domain navigation properties on User.** `User.Profile`, `User.UserEmails`, `User.TeamMemberships`, `User.RoleAssignments`, `User.Applications`, `User.ConsentRecords`, `User.CommunicationPreferences`, `User.GetEffectiveEmail()` still read freely from ~15 call sites (TeamService, GoogleWorkspaceSyncService, SendBoardDailyDigestJob, SyncLegalDocumentsJob, SystemTeamSyncJob, SuspendNonCompliantMembersJob, ProfileController). Small migration increments welcome.

**§15 working rules:**
- **One section per PR/commit.** Never half-migrate a section. If you extract a repository, finish the full stack (service + repo + cross-service interface changes) in the same commit.
- **Cross-section reads** go through `IOtherService.GetXAsync` methods — never `Include(otherSection)` across domain boundaries. Use §6b "in-memory join" (batched `GetByIdsAsync` + `ToDictionary`) to stitch display fields.
- **Cross-domain navs** get `[Obsolete]` marking per §6c; remaining read sites wrap with `#pragma warning disable CS0618` until the nav-strip follow-up.
- **New services from day one** follow §15 — repository the same day, not "migrate later."

## Architecture (4 layers)

```
src/Humans.Domain/          — Entities, enums, value objects (pure, no dependencies)
src/Humans.Application/     — Interfaces, DTOs, constants (business rules)
src/Humans.Infrastructure/  — EF Core, external services, Hangfire jobs
src/Humans.Web/             — Controllers, Razor views, authorization, tag helpers
tests/Humans.Application.Tests/ — Unit tests
```

Key entry points:
- `src/Humans.Web/Program.cs` — DI, middleware, startup
- `src/Humans.Web/Extensions/InfrastructureServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` — service registration
- `src/Humans.Infrastructure/Extensions/RecurringJobExtensions.cs` — Hangfire job setup

## EXCLUSION ZONES — DO NOT TOUCH

These files/directories are **completely off-limits**. Changes here risk data loss, broken migrations, or silent runtime failures:

```
src/Humans.Infrastructure/Data/HumansDbContext.cs
src/Humans.Infrastructure/Data/EntityConfigurations/**
src/Humans.Infrastructure/Migrations/**
```

Also do not modify:
- **Entity classes** in `src/Humans.Domain/Entities/` — do not rename properties, remove properties, change types, or restructure. Properties that appear unused are accessed via reflection (serialization, change tracking, cloning). Removing them silently breaks functionality.
- **Any `[JsonPropertyName]`, `[JsonInclude]`, `[JsonConstructor]`, `[JsonPolymorphic]`, or `[JsonDerivedType]` attributes** — these control serialization of persisted data.
- **Migration files** — never edit, never create manually.
- **ConsentRecord** — append-only table with database triggers preventing UPDATE/DELETE.
- **Test files** in `tests/` — don't modify existing tests. You may add new tests if useful but don't change existing ones.
- **Known-load-bearing lazy `IServiceProvider` resolutions.** `TeamService` uses lazy `IServiceProvider` resolution for `IEmailService` specifically to break the `UserService → TeamService → EmailService → UserEmailService → UserService` cycle. Do NOT "clean this up" — it goes away when `AccountMergeService` migrates to `Humans.Application.Services.Profile`. Check for a comment explaining why before removing any lazy-resolve pattern.
- **`IAuthorizationService` in service constructors.** Injecting `IAuthorizationService` pulls every authorization handler's transitive dependencies and can create construction cycles that only surface at startup. Services stay auth-free (§design-rules §2); authorization happens in controllers.

---

## CODING RULES (must follow during all changes)

1. **NodaTime for all dates/times** — Use `Instant`, `LocalDate`, `ZonedDateTime`. Never `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, or `DateOnly`.
2. **Explicit StringComparison** — Every `.Equals()`, `.Contains()`, `.StartsWith()`, `.EndsWith()`, `.IndexOf()`, `.Replace()` on strings must specify `StringComparison.Ordinal` or `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`.
3. **No enum comparison operators in LINQ-to-SQL** — Enums are stored as strings. `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` produce wrong results. Use `.Contains()` with explicit value lists.
4. **Magic string avoidance** — Use `nameof()` for action/controller names, `RoleNames.*` constants for role checks, constants or enums for repeated strings.
5. **Font Awesome 6 only** — `fa-solid fa-*` syntax. Bootstrap Icons (`bi bi-*`) are NOT loaded.
6. **UI terminology** — User-facing text says "humans" not "members"/"volunteers"/"users". The word "humans" stays in English across all locales. Use "birthday" not "date of birth".
7. **No concurrency tokens** — Do not add `IsConcurrencyToken()`, `[ConcurrencyCheck]`, or row versioning anywhere.
8. **Every new page needs a nav link** — If you create a controller action returning a view, add a navigation link to it.
9. **Admin pages don't need localization** — Views under `/Admin/*` and `/TeamAdmin/*` don't need `@Localizer[]` calls.

## Build Command

```
dotnet build Humans.slnx -v q && dotnet test Humans.slnx -v q --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Application"
```

## What "good" looks like

- **One way to do each thing.** If caching, error handling, or authorization uses 3 different patterns, pick the best one and consolidate.
- **Controllers are thin.** A controller action should: validate input, call a service, map the result, return a view. Business logic (LINQ transforms, multi-step mutations, domain decisions) belongs in services.
- **Services own their domain.** A TeamService should only contain team logic. If it has methods that query role assignments, budget data, or shift schedules, those methods belong elsewhere.
- **Large files are fine if cohesive.** A 2000-line service is not a problem if every method relates to the same domain. Do NOT split files just to reduce line count.
- **Shared patterns use shared code carefully.** Extract only when there are multiple live call sites, one obvious owner, and the extraction makes the net system simpler. If a ViewComponent exists but views use inline HTML instead, fix the views.
- **Reuse beats surface growth.** Before adding any new file, public type, interface method, service/repository method, DTO/view model, helper, endpoint, dependency, or DI registration, audit the existing owner/surface first. Follow `memory/process/reuse-first-change-discipline.md`.
- **Constants over magic strings.** Role names, cache keys, action names — all should reference constants or use `nameof()`.

## What to look for

**First, check the §15 priority section above.** If there's a specific §15 lead you can knock down, do that — it's higher-value than generic cleanup. Also check `docs/architecture/tech-debt-2026-04-23.md` for the current backlog with file:line citations; don't re-discover what's already catalogued there.

Otherwise use your judgement. Scan the codebase and prioritize by impact. Here are the *kinds* of smells worth finding — but don't limit yourself to these:

### Pattern divergence
When the same thing is done multiple ways across the codebase. Examples: caching (GetOrCreateAsync vs TryGetValue+Set vs Get+Set), error handling (TempData vs ModelState vs nothing), authorization (attributes vs inline checks vs service calls). Pick the best pattern and consolidate.

### Misplaced responsibilities
Methods or logic in the wrong layer or the wrong service. A controller doing business logic. A service containing methods that belong to a different domain. Code that queries across domain boundaries when it should delegate.

### Duplicated logic
The same LINQ query, validation check, or mapping logic appearing in multiple places. Extract only when there are multiple live call sites, a clear owner, and the extraction is simpler than local composition. Do not add a one-off helper or interface method just to make a single call site look cleaner.

### Inconsistent conventions
Naming (`GetXAsync` vs `FetchXAsync` vs `LoadXAsync`), method signatures, parameter ordering, return types. When you find inconsistency, standardize on the dominant convention.

### Unused abstraction or missing abstraction
A ViewComponent that exists but isn't used (views use inline HTML instead). A repeated pattern with no clear shared owner. An interface with a single implementation that adds no value. When in doubt, remove or reuse existing surface before adding another abstraction.

## SAFETY CHECKS

Before every change, verify:

1. **Am I touching an EF entity, migration, or DbContext configuration?** → STOP, skip this change.
2. **Am I renaming a property on a class that might be serialized to JSON?** → STOP, skip this change.
3. **Am I removing a property that looks unused?** → STOP, it's likely used via reflection.
4. **Am I changing a method signature on an interface in `Application/`?** → Check all implementations AND all callers.
5. **Am I adding durable surface?** → Audit the existing owner/surface first. Public/interface surface requires Peter approval.
6. **Am I changing authorization?** → Verify the attribute/policy matches the original access level exactly.
7. **Am I removing a lazy `IServiceProvider` resolution?** → Check for a comment explaining why. If it exists to break a ctor cycle (common in §15 migrations), leave it alone.
8. **Am I splitting a large "god class" service?** → STOP. Large cohesive services are preferred over fragmented ones here; splitting breaks caching and cross-method state. Do NOT split services to reduce line count.
9. **Am I about to half-migrate a §15 section?** → STOP. If you extract a repository you must also move the service to `Humans.Application.Services.X`, stitch cross-section reads through owning-service interfaces, and commit everything together.
10. **Does `dotnet build Humans.slnx` still pass?** → Must pass after every change.
11. **Does `dotnet test Humans.slnx` still pass?** → Must pass after every change.
