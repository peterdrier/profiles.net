# Background Jobs

## Business Context

Several system operations need to run automatically without user interaction: syncing legal documents from GitHub, sending compliance reminders, enforcing membership rules, and maintaining system team membership. Hangfire provides reliable job scheduling and execution.

## Job Overview

| Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| SyncLegalDocumentsJob | Daily 4 AM | Sync docs from GitHub |
| SendReConsentReminderJob | Daily | Remind about missing consents |
| SuspendNonCompliantMembersJob | Daily 4:30 AM | Enforce compliance deadlines |
| ProcessAccountDeletionsJob | Daily | Process account deletion requests |
| SystemTeamSyncJob | **DISABLED** | Sync system team membership + Google permissions |
| GoogleResourceReconciliationJob | **DISABLED** | Full Google resource reconciliation |
| DriveActivityMonitorJob | Hourly | Check Drive Activity API for anomalous permission changes |

> **Note:** `SystemTeamSyncJob` and `GoogleResourceReconciliationJob` are currently disabled because they modify Google Shared Drive and Group permissions. Use the manual "Sync Now" button at `/Admin/GoogleSync` until automated sync is validated.

## Job Details

### SyncLegalDocumentsJob

**Purpose**: Keep legal documents synchronized with the canonical GitHub repository.

**Schedule**: Daily at 4:00 AM

**Process**:
```
1. Connect to GitHub API
2. For each configured document path:
   a. Fetch current commit SHA
   b. Compare with stored SHA
   c. If different:
      - Parse document content (ES/EN)
      - Create new DocumentVersion
      - Update LegalDocument.CurrentCommitSha
3. If any documents were updated:
   a. Identify all active users missing new required consents
   b. Send ONE consolidated "Action Required" email per user
   c. Log summary of updates and notifications
```

**Triggers**:
- New document versions requiring re-consent
- Email notifications to affected members (consolidated)
- Status changes for non-compliant members

**Error Handling**:
- GitHub API failures: Retry with backoff
- Parse failures: Log and skip, alert admin
- Partial sync: Continue with remaining docs
- N+1 Protection: Users loaded in batches for notification loop

---

### SendReConsentReminderJob

**Purpose**: Notify members who have missing required consents before enforcement deadlines.

**Schedule**: Daily at 6:00 AM

**Process**:
```
1. Get all users with active roles
2. For each user:
   a. Check for missing required consents
   b. If missing and reminder not sent recently:
      - Calculate days until deadline
      - Select appropriate email template
      - Queue email notification
      - Update last reminder timestamp
3. Log reminder summary
```

**Reminder Timeline**:
```
Day 0:  Document updated (or user becomes active)
Day 1:  First reminder: "Action required"
Day 7:  Second reminder: "One week remaining"
Day 14: Final warning: "Urgent action needed"
Day 30: Suspension (handled by SuspendJob)
```

**Email Content**:
- List of documents needing consent
- Direct links to consent pages
- Deadline date
- Consequences of non-compliance

---

### SuspendNonCompliantMembersJob

**Purpose**: Automatically set members to Inactive status and revoke access when they exceed the consent grace period.

**Schedule**: Daily at 4:30 AM

**Process**:
```
1. Get all users with:
   - Active role assignments
   - Missing required consents
   - Grace period exceeded (e.g. >7 days since update)
2. For each user:
   a. Send suspension notice email
   b. Explicitly revoke access to all Google Drive folders and Groups
   c. Log action with reason
3. Generate compliance report
```

**Safeguards**:
- Only affects users with active roles (not already None)
- Never automatically sets IsSuspended (admin-only)
- Logs all actions for audit
- Access automatically restored by ConsentController when signed

---

### ProcessAccountDeletionsJob

**Purpose**: Anonymize accounts where the 30-day GDPR deletion grace period has expired.

**Schedule**: Daily

**Process**:
```
1. Find users where DeletionScheduledFor <= now
2. For each user:
   a. Anonymize user record (display name, email, phone, pronouns, DOB, profile picture, emergency contacts)
   b. Remove related data (UserEmails, ContactFields, VolunteerHistoryEntries)
   c. End all team memberships (LeftAt = now)
   d. End active role assignments (ValidTo = now)
   e. Disable login (LockoutEnd = MaxValue, rotate SecurityStamp)
   f. Clear DeletionRequestedAt / DeletionScheduledFor
   g. Audit log: AccountAnonymized
   h. Send confirmation email to original address
3. SaveChanges (single transaction for all users)
```

**Google deprovisioning**: Not handled by this job. Team membership endings (step 2c) are picked up by the normal sync jobs (`SystemTeamSyncJob` / `GoogleResourceReconciliationJob`), which remove the corresponding Google Group memberships and Shared Drive permissions. This keeps deprovisioning on the same code path as any other team departure.

**Preserved for audit trail**: ConsentRecords and Applications are kept (anonymized implicitly via the user record). ConsentRecords are immutable (DB triggers prevent UPDATE/DELETE).

See [Profiles — Account Deletion](02-profiles.md#account-deletion-right-to-erasure) for the full user-facing workflow.

### SystemTeamSyncJob

**Purpose**: Maintain automatic membership for the three system teams based on eligibility criteria. Also syncs Google Shared Drive and Group permissions for each membership change.

**Schedule**: Hourly (**CURRENTLY DISABLED** for scheduled runs — modifies Google permissions). Can be triggered manually from Admin dashboard via "Sync System Teams" button.

**Inline Triggers**: In addition to the scheduled job, single-user sync is triggered immediately by:
- `AdminController.ApproveVolunteer` — after setting `IsApproved = true`
- `ConsentController.Submit` — after recording a consent

Both call `SyncVolunteersMembershipForUserAsync(userId)`, which evaluates a single user without affecting other members.

**Process**:
```
1. SyncVolunteersTeamAsync()
   - Eligible: Approved (IsApproved), non-suspended, with all required Volunteers-team consents
   - Add: New eligible users
   - Remove: Users who lost eligibility

2. SyncLeadsTeamAsync()
   - Eligible: Users who are Lead of any user-created team + Leads-team consents
   - Add: New leads
   - Remove: Users who are no longer lead anywhere

3. SyncBoardTeamAsync()
   - Eligible: Users with active "Board" RoleAssignment + Board-team consents
   - Add: New board members
   - Remove: Users whose assignment expired

4. For each membership change:
   - Update Google resource permissions
   - Log change for audit
```

**System Teams**:
| Team | Eligibility Criteria |
|------|---------------------|
| Volunteers | IsApproved AND !IsSuspended AND HasAllRequiredConsentsForTeam(Volunteers) |
| Leads | TeamMember.Role = Lead (non-system teams) AND HasAllRequiredConsentsForTeam(Leads) |
| Board | RoleAssignment.RoleName = "Board" AND active AND HasAllRequiredConsentsForTeam(Board) |

**Single-User Sync**: `SyncVolunteersMembershipForUserAsync(userId)` evaluates one user against the Volunteers team criteria and adds or removes them without affecting other members. This is the mechanism that makes volunteer onboarding feel immediate rather than waiting for a scheduled job.

---

### GoogleResourceReconciliationJob

**Purpose**: Full reconciliation of all Google resources (Shared Drive folders + Groups) with the expected state from the database.

**Schedule**: Daily at 3:00 AM (**CURRENTLY DISABLED**)

**Process**:
```
1. Call SyncAllResourcesAsync()
   - For each active GoogleResource:
     a. Groups: paginate members from Google, diff with DB, add/remove
     b. Shared Drive folders: paginate direct permissions (excluding inherited),
        diff with DB, add/remove
   - Per-resource error handling (log + store ErrorMessage, continue)
2. Update LastSyncedAt on each resource
```

> **Currently disabled** in Program.cs. Use manual "Sync Now" at `/Admin/GoogleSync` instead.

## Hangfire Configuration

### Registration (Program.cs)
```csharp
// Configure Hangfire
builder.Services.AddHangfire(config => config
    .SetDataCompatibilityLevel(CompatibilityLevel.Version_180)
    .UseSimpleAssemblyNameTypeSerializer()
    .UseRecommendedSerializerSettings()
    .UsePostgreSqlStorage(options =>
        options.UseNpgsqlConnection(connectionString)));

builder.Services.AddHangfireServer();

// Register jobs
builder.Services.AddScoped<SystemTeamSyncJob>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<SyncLegalDocumentsJob>();
// ... etc

// Schedule recurring jobs
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate<SystemTeamSyncJob>(
    "system-team-sync",
    job => job.ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken.None),
    Cron.Hourly);
```

### Dashboard
- URL: `/hangfire`
- Authorization: Admin role required (production)
- Features: Job status, retry failed jobs, trigger manual runs

## Job Implementation Pattern

All jobs follow this pattern:
```csharp
public class ExampleJob
{
    private readonly ILogger<ExampleJob> _logger;
    private readonly IClock _clock;
    // ... dependencies

    public async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Starting job at {Time}",
            _clock.GetCurrentInstant());

        try
        {
            // Job logic here
            await DoWorkAsync(ct);

            _logger.LogInformation("Completed job successfully");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Error in job");
            throw; // Let Hangfire handle retry
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling & Retries

### Hangfire Automatic Retries
- Default: 10 retries with exponential backoff
- Visible in dashboard with error details
- Failed jobs moved to "Failed" queue after all retries

### Custom Retry Logic
```csharp
[AutomaticRetry(Attempts = 3)]
public async Task ExecuteAsync(...)
{
    // Job with custom retry count
}
```

### Error Notification
- Critical job failures logged to Serilog
- Can be routed to Slack/email via Serilog sinks
- Dashboard shows failed job details

## Monitoring

### Metrics (via OpenTelemetry)
- `hangfire_jobs_processed_total` - Counter by job type
- `hangfire_jobs_failed_total` - Counter by job type
- `hangfire_job_duration_seconds` - Histogram

### Health Check
```csharp
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddHangfire(options =>
        options.MinimumAvailableServers = 1,
        name: "hangfire");
```

### Alerts
- No Hangfire server available
- Job failure rate > threshold
- Queue backlog growing

## Testing Jobs

### Unit Testing
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task SyncJob_ShouldAddNewMembers()
{
    // Arrange: Mock dependencies
    var dbContext = CreateTestDbContext();
    var job = new SystemTeamSyncJob(dbContext, ...);

    // Act
    await job.SyncVolunteersTeamAsync();

    // Assert
    var team = await dbContext.Teams
        .Include(t => t.Members)
        .FirstAsync(t => t.SystemTeamType == SystemTeamType.Volunteers);
    Assert.Contains(team.Members, m => m.UserId == expectedUserId);
}
```

### Manual Trigger
Via Hangfire dashboard or:
```csharp
BackgroundJob.Enqueue<SystemTeamSyncJob>(
    job => job.ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken.None));
```
