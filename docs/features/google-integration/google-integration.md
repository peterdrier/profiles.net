# Google Integration

## Business Context

Nobodies Collective uses Google Workspace for collaboration. The system integrates with **Shared Drives** and **Google Groups** to manage shared resources for teams. Resources can be either provisioned automatically or linked manually by admins when pre-shared with the service account.

> **Important: All Drive resources are Shared Drives.** This system does not use regular (My Drive) folders. All permission logic accounts for Shared Drive behavior, including inherited permissions from the drive level.

## User Stories

### US-7.1: Team Shared Drive Provisioning
**As a** team
**I want to** have a Shared Drive folder automatically created
**So that** team members can collaborate on documents

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Folder created in the organization's Shared Drive
- Named appropriately (e.g., "Team: [Team Name]")
- Tracked in system for permission management
- All API calls use `SupportsAllDrives = true`

### US-7.2: Automatic Access Grants
**As a** new team member
**I want to** automatically get access to the team's Google resources
**So that** I can immediately participate in team work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Access granted on join approval
- Uses member's Google account (OAuth-linked)
- Appropriate permission level (Editor/Writer)
- Notification that access was granted

### US-7.3: Automatic Access Revocation
**As a** team
**I want** former members to lose access to resources
**So that** team documents remain protected

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Access revoked on leave
- Access revoked on removal by admin
- Revocation logged for audit
- Works even if user account is disabled
- Only direct permissions are removed (inherited Shared Drive permissions are not touched)
- Affected user is notified by email — see [`41-google-removal-notifications.md`](../google-integration/google-removal-notifications.md) for variant logic, suppression cases, and localization.

### US-7.4: Resource Sync Status & Drift Detection
**As an** administrator
**I want to** see the status of Google resource sync and any drift
**So that** I can troubleshoot access issues and verify correctness

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sync status page at `/Teams/Sync` shows all active resources (accessible to TeamsAdmin, Board, Admin)
- Tabbed interface: Google Drive tab and Google Groups tab
- Per-tab preview loads via AJAX (read-only API calls)
- Summary cards per tab: Total Resources, In Sync, Drifted, Errors
- Per-resource table showing members to add/remove
- Drifted resources shown first
- "Sync Now" button per resource (Admin-only, executes adds/removes based on sync mode)
- "Sync All" button per tab (Admin-only)
- Inherited Shared Drive permissions are excluded from drift detection

### US-7.5: Link Existing Shared Drive Folder
**As a** Board member or authorized Coordinator
**I want to** link an existing Shared Drive folder to a team
**So that** team members automatically get access to the shared folder

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin pastes a Google Drive folder URL
- System validates the service account has access to the folder
- If access denied, shows clear instructions with service account email to share with
- Folder metadata (name, URL) fetched and saved as GoogleResource
- Duplicate links prevented (same folder + team)
- Supports multiple URL formats (direct, u/0, open?id=)
- All API calls use `SupportsAllDrives = true`

### US-7.5b: Link Existing Drive File
**As a** Board member or authorized Coordinator
**I want to** link an individual Drive file (Sheet, Doc, Slides, etc.) to a team
**So that** team members automatically get access to specific shared files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin pastes a Google Drive file URL (Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms, or generic /file/d/ URLs)
- System validates the service account has access to the file
- If access denied, shows clear instructions with service account email to share with
- File metadata (name, URL) fetched and saved as GoogleResource with type DriveFile
- Duplicate links prevented (same file + team)
- Rejects folder URLs with a helpful redirect message
- All API calls use `SupportsAllDrives = true`
- Permission sync works the same as for folders (writer access for team members)

### US-7.6: Link Existing Google Group
**As a** Board member or authorized Coordinator
**I want to** link an existing Google Group to a team
**So that** team membership automatically syncs with group membership

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin enters a Google Group email address
- System validates the service account has access to the group
- If access denied, shows clear instructions with service account email
- Group metadata (name, ID) fetched and saved as GoogleResource
- Duplicate links prevented (same group + team)

### US-7.7: Unlink Resource
**As a** Board member or authorized Coordinator
**I want to** unlink a Google resource from a team
**So that** the association is removed without deleting the resource

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Soft unlink: sets IsActive = false (preserves audit trail)
- Resource disappears from active list
- Google permissions are NOT automatically revoked (manual cleanup)

### US-7.8: Coordinator Resource Management
**As an** admin
**I want to** control whether Coordinators can manage team resources
**So that** I can delegate resource management when appropriate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Controlled by `TeamResourceManagement:AllowLeadsToManageResources` config setting
- Default: false (only Board members can manage)
- When enabled, Coordinators can link/unlink/sync resources for their teams

## Google Group Membership Sync Architecture

Google Group membership is reconciled by `IGoogleGroupSync`, not by the Drive-oriented `IGoogleSyncService` gateway. `IGoogleGroupMembershipSource` is a plugin interface: each source returns expected user IDs for the Google group keys it owns, and the orchestrator performs the shared work of hydrating users/emails, filtering deletion/merge/suspension/rejected-email state, diffing against Google, and applying changes.

`TeamService` directly implements `IGoogleGroupMembershipSource` for team Google Groups. `ITeamService` intentionally does not inherit the source interface; Google Integration registers the concrete Teams service as a source so group membership ownership remains explicit and does not expand the general Teams boundary.

Collision handling is fail-closed. If more than one source claims the same group key, `IGoogleGroupSync` logs and audits the collision and skips mutation for that group. First-wins would be unsafe because one source could silently remove members owned by another source.

`ReconcileAllAsync` is the daily and bulk-preview/bulk-execute path. It loads all claims, hydrates expected users once for the pass, and reports per-group errors without scheduling scoped retries. `ReconcileOneAsync` is the scoped path used by Hangfire requests after membership/email changes and by per-row Execute in the UI; when scoped Execute hits a Google API failure, it schedules another scoped Hangfire attempt after the retry delay.

Group sync requests use Hangfire instead of in-process retry. Team membership and email changes commit first, then enqueue scoped group reconciliation by group key. This keeps Google API failures outside the Teams transaction and makes retries visible and independently executable.

## Data Model

### GoogleResource Entity
```
GoogleResource
├── Id: Guid
├── ResourceType: GoogleResourceType [enum]
├── GoogleId: string (256) [unique, Google's ID]
├── Name: string (512)
├── Url: string? (2048) [Google Drive URL]
├── TeamId: Guid (FK → Team, required)
├── ProvisionedAt: Instant
├── LastSyncedAt: Instant?
├── IsActive: bool
├── ErrorMessage: string? (2000)
├── DrivePermissionLevel: DrivePermissionLevel [enum, Drive only]
└── RestrictInheritedAccess: bool [default false, Drive folders only]
```

### GoogleResourceType Enum
```
DriveFolder  = 0  // Shared Drive folder
SharedDrive  = 1  // Shared Drive (reserved)
Group        = 2  // Google Group
DriveFile    = 3  // Individual file within a Shared Drive (Google Sheets, Docs, etc.)
```

> **Note:** `DriveFolder` refers to folders within Shared Drives, not regular My Drive folders. The `SharedDrive` value is reserved for future use if top-level Shared Drives need to be tracked separately. `DriveFile` covers any individual file (Sheets, Docs, Slides, etc.) on a Shared Drive.

## Service Interface

### IGoogleSyncService
```csharp
public interface IGoogleSyncService
{
    // Shared Drive folder provisioning
    Task<GoogleResource> ProvisionTeamFolderAsync(Guid teamId, string folderName, CancellationToken ct);

    // Drive resource sync (Groups are delegated to IGoogleGroupSync)
    Task<SyncPreviewResult> SyncResourcesByTypeAsync(GoogleResourceType resourceType, SyncAction action, CancellationToken ct);
    Task<ResourceSyncDiff> SyncSingleResourceAsync(Guid resourceId, SyncAction action, CancellationToken ct);

    // Team membership changes
    Task AddUserToTeamResourcesAsync(Guid teamId, Guid userId, CancellationToken ct);
    Task RemoveUserFromTeamResourcesAsync(Guid teamId, Guid userId, CancellationToken ct);

    // Status
    Task<GoogleResource?> GetResourceStatusAsync(Guid resourceId, CancellationToken ct);

    // Google Group lifecycle/settings, not membership
    Task EnsureTeamGroupAsync(Guid teamId, bool confirmReactivation = false, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task<GoogleResource> ProvisionTeamGroupAsync(Guid teamId, string groupEmail, string groupName, CancellationToken ct);
    // Restoration
    Task RestoreUserToAllTeamsAsync(Guid userId, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

### IGoogleGroupSync
```csharp
public interface IGoogleGroupSync
{
    Task RequestSyncAsync(string groupKey, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task<SyncPreviewResult> ReconcileAllAsync(SyncAction action, CancellationToken ct = default);
    Task<ResourceSyncDiff> ReconcileOneAsync(string groupKey, SyncAction action, CancellationToken ct = default);
}
```

### SyncAction Enum
```
Preview       = 0  // Compute diff only, make no changes
AddOnly       = 1  // Compute diff and execute adds only
AddAndRemove  = 2  // Compute diff and execute adds + removes
```

Used as a parameter in sync methods (not persisted). The reconciliation job maps its persisted `SyncMode` setting to the appropriate `SyncAction` at runtime.

### SyncPreviewResult / ResourceSyncDiff
```csharp
public class ResourceSyncDiff
{
    public Guid ResourceId { get; init; }
    public string ResourceName, ResourceType, TeamName, GoogleId, Url, ErrorMessage;
    public List<string> MembersToAdd { get; init; } = [];
    public List<string> MembersToRemove { get; init; } = [];
    public bool IsInSync => MembersToAdd.Count == 0 && MembersToRemove.Count == 0 && ErrorMessage == null;
}

public class SyncPreviewResult
{
    public List<ResourceSyncDiff> Diffs { get; init; } = [];
    public int TotalResources => Diffs.Count;
    public int InSyncCount => Diffs.Count(d => d.IsInSync);
    public int DriftCount => Diffs.Count(d => !d.IsInSync);
}
```

## Shared Drive Permission Model

All Drive resources in this system are on Shared Drives. This has important implications for permission management:

### Inherited vs Direct Permissions
- **Inherited permissions** come from the Shared Drive itself (e.g., all drive members get access to all folders). These are NOT managed by this system and are excluded from drift detection and sync.
- **Direct permissions** are set on individual folders within the Shared Drive. These ARE managed by this system.

### Permission Filtering Logic
When listing permissions, the system uses `permissionDetails` from the Drive API to distinguish inherited from direct:
```csharp
// A permission is considered "direct" (managed by us) if:
// 1. Type is "user" (not domain, group, or anyone)
// 2. Role is not "owner"
// 3. Has a valid email address
// 4. Is not a service account (.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
// 5. Is NOT inherited (permissionDetails.All(d => d.Inherited) == false)
```

### API Requirements
All Drive API calls MUST use:
- `SupportsAllDrives = true`
- `Fields` including `permissionDetails` when listing permissions

### Multi-Team Permission Level Resolution
When the same Drive resource (same `GoogleId`) is linked to multiple teams with different `DrivePermissionLevel` values, the system resolves the **maximum** level before setting permissions. For example, if Team A links a folder as Viewer and Team B links the same folder as Contributor, a user who belongs to both teams gets Contributor access.

This resolution happens:
- **Before the Drive API call** — not after. The max level is computed and passed to `AddUserToDriveAsync`.
- **In `SyncDriveResourceGroupAsync`** — resources are grouped by `GoogleId`, and the max level across the group is used for all adds.
- **In `AddUserToTeamResourcesAsync`** — when a user is added to a team, the max level is queried across all active resources with the same `GoogleId`.
- **During reconciliation** — the daily job detects `WrongRole` drift when a user's current Google permission is lower than the resolved max, and upgrades it.

## Subteam Member Rollup

When a department (parent team) has child sub-teams, the effective membership for Google resource sync includes both direct department members and all active members of child teams. This ensures sub-team members automatically get access to department-level resources.

**Key behaviors:**
- Rollup is one-way: sub-team members get parent department resources. Parent members do NOT get sub-team resources.
- On subteam join: `AddUserToTeamResourcesAsync` immediately adds the user to parent department resources.
- On subteam leave: removal is deferred to the reconciliation job, which recomputes effective membership. If the user is still a direct department member or in another sub-team, they keep access.
- The department detail page (`/Teams/{slug}`) shows a "Humans via sub-teams" section with source team badges, visually distinct from direct members.

**Sync methods that include rollup:**
- `SyncGroupResourceAsync` — includes child team members via `GetChildTeamMembersAsync`
- `SyncDriveResourceGroupAsync` — includes child team members via `GetChildTeamMembersAsync`

## Permission Sync

### Full Sync (SyncResourcePermissionsAsync)
For Shared Drive folders:
1. Load expected members from DB (team members where `LeftAt == null`, plus child team members for departments)
2. List current direct permissions from Google (paginated, with `permissionDetails`)
3. Filter to direct managed permissions only (exclude inherited, owner, service account)
4. Add missing permissions (expected but not in Google)
5. Remove stale permissions (in Google but not expected)
6. Detect permission level drift (member has access but at wrong level) and upgrade
7. Update `LastSyncedAt`

For Google Groups:
1. Load expected members from DB (team members where `LeftAt == null`, plus child team members for departments)
2. List current group members from Google (paginated)
3. Add missing members
4. Remove stale members
5. Update `LastSyncedAt`

### Preview (PreviewSyncAllAsync)
Same diff logic as full sync, but read-only — no writes to Google APIs.

## Sync Mode Settings

Per-service sync modes control what automated jobs and manual sync actions do. Stored in the `sync_service_settings` table and managed via the Admin Sync Settings page at `/Google/SyncSettings`.

### SyncServiceSettings Entity
```
SyncServiceSettings
├── Id: Guid
├── ServiceType: SyncServiceType [enum]
├── SyncMode: SyncMode [enum]
├── UpdatedAt: Instant
└── UpdatedByUserId: Guid? (FK → User)
```

### SyncServiceType Enum
```
GoogleDrive   = 0
GoogleGroups  = 1
Discord       = 2  // reserved for future use
```

### SyncMode Enum
```
None          = 0  // Jobs skip this service entirely
AddOnly       = 1  // Only add missing members
AddAndRemove  = 2  // Add missing + remove extra members
```

All services default to `SyncMode.None` (seed data). An Admin must explicitly enable sync from the `/Google/SyncSettings` page before automated jobs or manual sync will modify Google resources.

### ISyncSettingsService
```csharp
public interface ISyncSettingsService
{
    Task<List<SyncServiceSettings>> GetAllAsync(CancellationToken ct);
    Task<SyncMode> GetModeAsync(SyncServiceType serviceType, CancellationToken ct);
    Task UpdateModeAsync(SyncServiceType serviceType, SyncMode mode, Guid actorUserId, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

## Google Group Lifecycle

### GoogleGroupPrefix on Team
Teams can have a `GoogleGroupPrefix` (e.g., `"events"` produces `events@nobodies.team`). This is set via the team edit form by TeamsAdmin, Board, or Admin users.

### EnsureTeamGroupAsync
When `GoogleGroupPrefix` is set on a team, `EnsureTeamGroupAsync` is called to:
1. Check if the team already has an active Group resource
2. If not, create (or link) the Google Group using the computed email
3. Apply configured `GroupSettings` (WhoCanViewMembership, WhoCanPostMessage, AllowExternalMembers) from `GoogleWorkspace:Groups` config

When `GoogleGroupPrefix` is cleared, the existing Group resource is deactivated (soft unlink). The Google Group itself is not deleted.

### Group Settings
Group creation applies all expected settings via `BuildExpectedGroupSettings()` — the same method used by drift detection, ensuring creation and detection share a single source of truth.

### Group Settings Drift Detection
Settings applied at group creation can drift if someone changes them manually in Google Admin. The system detects this drift:

**Checked settings** (from `GoogleWorkspace:Groups` config):
- WhoCanJoin, WhoCanViewMembership, WhoCanContactOwner, WhoCanPostMessage, WhoCanViewGroup, WhoCanModerateMembers, AllowExternalMembers

**Additional hardcoded settings** (applied at creation and checked for drift):
- IsArchived (expected: true — enables conversation history), MembersCanPostAsTheGroup (expected: true), IncludeInGlobalAddressList (expected: true), AllowWebPosting (expected: true), MessageModerationLevel (expected: MODERATE_NONE), SpamModerationLevel (expected: MODERATE), EnableCollaborativeInbox (expected: true)

**Nightly check + auto-remediation:** Runs as part of `GoogleResourceReconciliationJob` (daily at 03:00). When drift is detected, settings are automatically reapplied via `RemediateGroupSettingsAsync`. Each remediation is audit-logged (`GoogleResourceSettingsRemediated`). Failures are logged but don't stop the reconciliation.

**Manual trigger:** The Google admin page at `/Google` has a "Check Group Settings" button. Results show at `/Google/GroupSettingsResults` with per-group cards listing each drifted setting (expected vs actual) and links to the group in Google.

**SyncSettings respected:** If GoogleGroups sync mode is set to None, both the check and auto-remediation are skipped entirely.

## Resource Linking (Pre-Shared Access Model)

Instead of creating resources with domain-wide delegation, admins can link existing Google resources that have been pre-shared with the service account.

### Access Model
- **Shared Drive folders**: Admin shares the folder with the service account email as "Editor"
- **Google Groups**: Admin adds the service account as a Group Manager
- The service account authenticates as itself (no impersonation) for validation/linking

### ITeamResourceService
Separate interface from IGoogleSyncService for linking/validation (not provisioning):
```csharp
public interface ITeamResourceService
{
    Task<IReadOnlyList<GoogleResource>> GetTeamResourcesAsync(Guid teamId, ...);
    Task<LinkResourceResult> LinkDriveFolderAsync(Guid teamId, string folderUrl, ...);
    Task<LinkResourceResult> LinkDriveFileAsync(Guid teamId, string fileUrl, ...);
    Task<LinkResourceResult> LinkGroupAsync(Guid teamId, string groupEmail, ...);
    Task UnlinkResourceAsync(Guid resourceId, ...);
    Task<bool> CanManageTeamResourcesAsync(Guid teamId, Guid userId, ...);
    Task<string> GetServiceAccountEmailAsync(...);
}
```

### Resource Linking Flow
```

### Drive Folder URL Parsing
Supports multiple Google Drive URL formats:
- `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{id}`
- `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/{id}`
- `https://drive.google.com/open?id={id}`
- `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{id}?usp=sharing`
- Direct folder ID

### Drive File URL Parsing
Supports multiple Google Drive/Docs URL formats:
- `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{id}/...`
- `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{id}/...`
- `https://docs.google.com/document/d/{id}/...`
- `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/{id}/...`
- `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/{id}/...`
- `https://drive.google.com/open?id={id}`
- Direct file ID

### Authorization
- Board members: can manage resources for any team
- Coordinators: controlled by `TeamResourceManagement:AllowLeadsToManageResources` (default: false)

### Route: `/Teams/{slug}/Admin/Resources`
Actions:
| Route | Method | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `Resources` | GET | View linked resources + link forms |
| `Resources/LinkDrive` | POST | Link a Shared Drive folder by URL |
| `Resources/LinkFile` | POST | Link a Drive file (Sheet, Doc, etc.) by URL |
| `Resources/LinkGroup` | POST | Link a Google Group by email |
| `Resources/{id}/Unlink` | POST | Soft-unlink (IsActive = false) |
| `Resources/{id}/Sync` | POST | Trigger permission sync |

## Sync Status Page

### Route: `/Google/Sync`
Accessible to TeamsAdmin, Board, and Admin. Shows drift across all active resources with a tabbed interface (Google Drive / Google Groups). Formerly at `/Teams/Sync`.

| Route | Method | Auth | Action |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| `/Google/Sync` | GET | TeamsAdmin, Board, Admin | Sync status page |
| `/Google/Sync/Preview/{resourceType}` | GET | TeamsAdmin, Board, Admin | AJAX: preview drift for resource type |
| `/Google/Sync/Execute/{resourceId}` | POST | Admin only | Execute sync for one resource |
| `/Google/Sync/ExecuteAll/{resourceType}` | POST | Admin only | Execute sync for all resources of a type |

### Summary Cards (per tab)
- **Total Resources** — count of active GoogleResource records of that type
- **In Sync** — resources where expected == actual
- **Drifted** — resources with members to add or remove
- **Errors** — resources where the API call failed

### Resource Table
Per resource: Name, Team, Status badge, members to add/remove.
Drifted resources shown first, then in-sync.

### Sync Settings Page

#### Route: `/Google/SyncSettings`
Admin-only page for configuring per-service sync modes. Formerly at `/Google/SyncSettings`.

| Route | Method | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `/Google/SyncSettings` | GET | View current sync mode per service |
| `/Google/SyncSettings` | POST | Update sync mode for a service |

> **Note:** The legacy `/Admin/GoogleSync` route (combined sync preview/apply) has been removed. All sync operations are now at `/Google/Sync`.

## Stub Implementations

Both `IGoogleSyncService` and `ITeamResourceService` have stub implementations for development without Google credentials:
- `StubGoogleSyncService`: logs provisioning/sync actions, returns empty preview
- `StubTeamResourceService`: performs real DB operations but simulates Google API validation

Stub vs. real implementation is selected automatically based on whether `GoogleWorkspace:ServiceAccountKeyPath` or `GoogleWorkspace:ServiceAccountKeyJson` is configured.

## Background Jobs

### GoogleResourceReconciliationJob
```
Schedule: 3:00 AM daily (mode-gated via SyncSettings)
Purpose: Full reconciliation of all Google resources with DB state
Process: Reads SyncMode per service from sync_service_settings, then calls
         SyncResourcesByTypeAsync with the appropriate SyncAction
```

**Mode-gated behavior:**
- `SyncMode.None` — job skips the service entirely
- `SyncMode.AddOnly` — job computes diff and only adds missing members
- `SyncMode.AddAndRemove` — job computes diff, adds missing and removes extra members

**Drive folder path updates:** After permission sync, the job calls `UpdateDriveFolderPathsAsync` to fetch the current folder name and parent chain for each active Drive resource via the Drive API (`files.get` with `fields=name,parents`). If a folder has been renamed or moved, `GoogleResource.Name` is updated to reflect the full logical path (e.g. "Shared Drive / Department / Subfolder"). This keeps the `/Teams/Sync` page accurate without requiring manual intervention.

> Jobs are active but mode-gated: each service must have its sync mode set to AddOnly or AddAndRemove at `/Google/SyncSettings` before the job will modify Google resources.

### SystemTeamSyncJob
```
Schedule: Hourly (mode-gated via SyncSettings)
Purpose: Sync system team membership and Google resource permissions
```

### System Team Sync
When system teams are synced, Google permissions are also updated:
- New member → Add to Shared Drive folders + Groups
- Removed member → Remove from Shared Drive folders + Groups

## Error Handling

### Outbox Sync Error Classification

The `ProcessGoogleSyncOutboxJob` classifies Google API errors into two categories:

**Permanent failures (HTTP 400, 403, 404):** User-level errors — invalid email format, no Google account for that address, or user not found. The outbox event is marked `FailedPermanently = true` and the user's `GoogleEmailStatus` is set to `Rejected`. While rejected, no new sync events are enqueued for that user and the user is excluded from all sync paths (reconciliation, outbox, direct add). The user must update their Google email (Profile → Emails), which resets `GoogleEmailStatus` to `Unknown` and triggers re-sync for all current team memberships.

**Transient failures (all other errors including 429, 5xx):** Retried up to 10 times with exponential backoff.

`GoogleEmailStatus` is set to `Valid` only after a successful `AddUserToTeamResources` event where the team has linked Google resources — ensuring the email was actually accepted by a Google API call. A `Rejected` status is never overwritten with `Valid`; the user must change their email to reset it.

### Resource-Level Retry Strategy
```
On Google API error (resource provisioning):
  1. Log error with details
  2. Store error in GoogleResource.ErrorMessage
  3. Set IsActive = false if persistent
  4. Background job will retry on next sync
```

### Error Scenarios
| Error | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| Rate limit exceeded (429) | Transient — retry with backoff |
| User not found (404) | Permanent — mark user email rejected |
| Invalid email (400) | Permanent — mark user email rejected |
| Permission denied (403) | Permanent — no Google account for address, mark rejected |
| Folder not found | Re-provision |
| Inherited permission delete | Skip (cannot remove inherited Shared Drive permissions) |

### Admin Digest Reporting

The daily admin digest reports sync health:
- **Failed sync events (transient):** Unprocessed events with errors, still being retried
- **Humans with rejected email:** Distinct users with `GoogleEmailStatus = Rejected`
- **Transient retries:** Events being retried (have errors but not permanently failed)

## Security Considerations

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Only grant Writer, not Owner
2. **Service Account**: Never expose service account credentials
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all permission changes
4. **Revocation**: Ensure timely removal on leave/suspension
5. **Domain Restriction**: Only add users within the organization domain
6. **Inherited Permissions**: Never attempt to remove inherited Shared Drive permissions

## Configuration
