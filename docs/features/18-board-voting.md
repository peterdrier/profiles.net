# Board Voting

## Business Context

When a human applies for Colaborador or Asociado tier, the Board votes on their application. This replaces the previous model where a single Board member could approve/reject an Asociado application. The new model requires a structured vote with individual Board member input, a meeting date, and a collective decision note. Voting happens through a dedicated dashboard that shows all pending applications and each Board member's vote.

Board voting only applies to tier applications (Colaborador and Asociado). Volunteer access is handled automatically through the consent check gate — see [Onboarding Pipeline](16-onboarding-pipeline.md).

**GDPR data minimization:** Individual Board member votes are **deleted** when the application is finalized. Only the collective decision (approve/reject), meeting date, and decision note are retained as the audit record.

## Data Model

### VoteChoice Enum
```
VoteChoice:
  Yay = 0      // In favor
  Maybe = 1    // Leaning yes but has concerns
  No = 2       // Against
  Abstain = 3  // No position
```

### BoardVote Entity (Transient — Deleted on Finalization)
```
BoardVote
├── Id: Guid
├── ApplicationId: Guid (FK → Application)
├── BoardMemberUserId: Guid (FK → User)
├── Vote: VoteChoice
├── Note: string? (4000)
├── VotedAt: Instant
└── UpdatedAt: Instant?
```

**Important:** BoardVote records are **deleted** when the application is finalized. They are working data used during the decision process, not audit records. Only the Application's DecisionNote, BoardMeetingDate, and final Status are preserved.

### Application Changes (from 15-membership-tiers.md)
```
Application (new fields)
├── MembershipTier: MembershipTier (Colaborador or Asociado)
├── TermExpiresAt: LocalDate? (set on approval)
├── BoardMeetingDate: LocalDate? (when Board finalized)
├── DecisionNote: string? (4000) (Board's collective decision note)
└── Navigation: BoardVotes (transient collection, empty after finalization)
```

### Constraints
- Unique: `(ApplicationId, BoardMemberUserId)` — one vote per Board member per application
- BoardVote.Vote stored as string (like other enums)

## Workflow

### Voting Flow

```
Application enters Board queue
(ConsentCheckStatus = Cleared on the Profile, Application exists, Status = Submitted)
    │
    ▼
Board members cast individual votes (working data)
    │
    ▼
Any Board member finalizes decision
    │
    ├── Approve
    │   ├── Application.Status → Approved
    │   ├── Application.TermExpiresAt = Dec 31 of appropriate odd year
    │   ├── Application.BoardMeetingDate = entered date
    │   ├── Application.DecisionNote = entered note
    │   ├── Profile.MembershipTier → Application's tier
    │   ├── Add to Colaboradors/Asociados system team
    │   ├── Delete all BoardVote records for this Application
    │   └── Send approval notification email
    │
    └── Reject
        ├── Application.Status → Rejected
        ├── Application.BoardMeetingDate = entered date
        ├── Application.DecisionNote = reason (required)
        ├── Delete all BoardVote records for this Application
        └── Send rejection notification email
```

## Routes

| Route | Method | Action | Access |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| `/OnboardingReview/BoardVoting` | GET | Voting dashboard | Board, Admin |
| `/OnboardingReview/BoardVoting/{applicationId}` | GET | Application detail + vote form | Board, Admin |
| `/OnboardingReview/BoardVoting/{applicationId}/Vote` | POST | Cast/update vote | Board |
| `/OnboardingReview/BoardVoting/{applicationId}/Finalize` | POST | Finalize decision | Board, Admin |

## Business Rules

1. **Only Board members can vote** — Admin can view and finalize but not vote
2. **One vote per Board member per application** — can update before finalization
3. **Any Board member can finalize** — consensus model, not counting votes
4. **Cannot finalize without at least one vote** — prevents empty decisions
5. **Finalization is irreversible** — once approved/rejected, the decision stands
6. **Meeting date required** — audit trail requirement
7. **Decision note required for rejection** — applicant deserves to know why
8. **Individual votes deleted on finalization** — GDPR data minimization
9. **Approval triggers immediate tier enrollment** — added to system team, term starts
10. **Terms aligned to odd-year cycles** — Dec 31 of next appropriate odd year
