# F-12: Audit Log

## Business Context

Background jobs and admin actions make changes on members' behalf (team enrollment, Google Drive/Group access, suspensions, account anonymization). The Board needs a structured, queryable audit trail showing what the system does automatically and what admins do manually, beyond what Serilog text logs provide.

## Data Model

### AuditLogEntry (append-only)

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Id | Guid | PK |
| Action | AuditAction (string) | What happened |
| EntityType | string | "User", "Team", etc. |
| EntityId | Guid | Primary affected entity |
| Description | string | Human-readable text |
| OccurredAt | Instant | When |
| ActorUserId | Guid? | Human actor (null for jobs) |
| RelatedEntityId | Guid? | Secondary entity |
| RelatedEntityType | string? | "User", "Team", etc. |
| ResourceId | Guid? | FK to GoogleResource (Google sync only) |
| Success | bool? | Whether Google API call succeeded (Google sync only) |
| ErrorMessage | string? | Error details if call failed (Google sync only) |
| Role | string? | Role granted/revoked, e.g. "writer", "MEMBER" (Google sync only) |
| SyncSource | GoogleSyncSource? (string) | What triggered the sync action (Google sync only) |
| UserEmail | string? | Email at time of action, denormalized (Google sync only) |

Table: `audit_log`

### GoogleSyncSource Enum

Stored as string in the database. Values:
- `TeamMemberJoined` — User joined a team, triggering resource access
- `TeamMemberLeft` — User left a team, triggering revocation
- `ManualSync` — Admin clicked "Sync Now"
- `ScheduledSync` — Automated periodic sync
- `Suspension` — Member suspension triggered revocation
- `SystemTeamSync` — System team sync job

### Immutability

Database triggers prevent UPDATE and DELETE on the `audit_log` table, matching the pattern used for `consent_records`. The `ActorUserId` FK uses `SetNull` on delete, so deleted/anonymized users show as "Deleted User" in the UI.

### AuditAction Enum

Stored as string in the database. New values can be appended without migration.

**Team membership:**
- `TeamMemberAdded` — System sync added a user to a team
- `TeamMemberRemoved` — System sync removed a user from a team
- `TeamJoinedDirectly` — User joined an open team directly
- `TeamLeft` — User left a team voluntarily
- `TeamJoinRequestApproved` — Approver approved a team join request
- `TeamJoinRequestRejected` — Approver rejected a team join request
- `TeamMemberRoleChanged` — Member role changed within a team
- `TeamPageContentUpdated` — Team page content (markdown, CTAs, visibility) updated

**Member lifecycle:**
- `MemberSuspended` — Admin or system suspended a member
- `MemberUnsuspended` — Admin unsuspended a member
- `AccountAnonymized` — Account deletion job anonymized a user
- `MembershipsRevokedOnDeletionRequest` — Memberships ended when deletion was requested
- `VolunteerApproved` — Admin approved a volunteer
- `ConsentCheckCleared` — Consent Coordinator cleared a consent check
- `ConsentCheckFlagged` — Consent Coordinator flagged a consent check
- `SignupRejected` — Signup rejected (sets RejectedAt)
- `TierApplicationApproved` — Board approved a Colaborador/Asociado application
- `TierApplicationRejected` — Board rejected a Colaborador/Asociado application
- `TierDowngraded` — Human's tier was downgraded

**Roles:**
- `RoleAssigned` — Admin assigned a governance role
- `RoleEnded` — Admin ended a governance role
- `TeamRoleDefinitionCreated/Updated/Deleted` — Team role slot managed
- `TeamRoleAssigned/Unassigned` — Member assigned to/from a team role slot

**Google sync:**
- `GoogleResourceAccessGranted` — Google resource access granted (Group or Drive folder)
- `GoogleResourceAccessRevoked` — Google resource access revoked (Group or Drive folder)
- `GoogleResourceProvisioned` — New Google resource created (Drive folder or Group)
- `GoogleResourceDeactivated` — Google resource soft-unlinked
- `GoogleResourceSettingsRemediated` — Group settings drift auto-corrected
- `GoogleResourceInheritanceDriftCorrected` — Shared Drive inheritance setting fixed
- `AnomalousPermissionDetected` — Drive Activity API detected a permission change not made by the system

**Workspace accounts:**
- `WorkspaceAccountProvisioned` — @nobodies.team account created
- `WorkspaceAccountSuspended` — Workspace account suspended
- `WorkspaceAccountReactivated` — Workspace account reactivated
- `WorkspaceAccountPasswordReset` — Workspace account password reset
- `WorkspaceAccountLinked` — Existing workspace account linked to a human
- `WorkspaceAccountBackupCodesGenerated` — 2-Step Verification backup codes rotated for a Workspace account

**Other features:**
- `FacilitatedMessageSent` — User-to-user message sent via Humans
- `FeedbackResponseSent` / `FeedbackStatusChanged` — Feedback management
- `CommunicationPreferenceChanged` — User changed email/alert preferences
- `ContactCreated` — Admin created an external contact
- `AccountMergeRequested/Accepted/Rejected` — Duplicate account merge flow
- `CampCreated/Updated/Deleted`, `CampSeasonCreated/Approved/Rejected/Withdrawn/StatusChanged`, etc. — Camp management
- `ShiftSignupConfirmed/Refused/Voluntold/Bailed/NoShow/Cancelled` — Shift lifecycle
- `RotaMovedToTeam` — Shift rota reassigned to a different department

## Service Design

`IAuditLogService` provides two overloads:

1. **Job overload** — no human actor, accepts job name (prefixed to description)
2. **Human overload** — accepts actor user ID

The service adds entries to the `DbContext` without calling `SaveChangesAsync`. Entries are saved atomically with the caller's business operation.

### Google Sync Audit (LogGoogleSyncAsync)

For permission-change actions, `LogGoogleSyncAsync` populates the Google-specific nullable fields alongside the standard fields. This provides structured detail for per-resource and per-user audit views without requiring a separate table.

The service method sets `EntityType = "GoogleResource"` and `EntityId = resourceId` for these entries.

## User Interface

### Global Audit Log Page (`/Board/AuditLog`)

Accessible to Board and Admin. Displays all audit log entries with filtering by action type. Features:
- Filter buttons: All, Anomalous Permissions, Access Granted/Revoked, Suspensions, Roles
- Anomalous entries highlighted with warning styling
- Alert banner showing total anomaly count
- Paginated (50 per page)

### Drive Activity Check (`/Google/AuditLog/CheckDriveActivity`)

POST action on `GoogleController`. Manual trigger for the Drive Activity monitor. Redirects to `/Board/AuditLog?filter=AnomalousPermissionDetected` after completion.

### Per-Resource Google Sync Audit (`/Google/Sync/Resource/{id}/Audit`)

Displays all audit entries for a specific Google resource, queried by `ResourceId`. Shows structured Google sync details: user email, role, sync source, success/failure status, and error messages. Accessible to Board and Admin. Accessed via "Audit" button on each row of the Google Sync page.

### Per-User Google Sync Audit (`/Google/Human/{id}/SyncAudit`)

Displays all Google sync audit entries affecting a specific user, queried by `RelatedEntityId = userId` where `ResourceId IS NOT NULL`. Includes the Google resource name via navigation property. Accessible to HumanAdmin and Admin. Accessed via the Member Detail page sidebar.

### Per-User Audit View (MemberDetail page)

Displays the 50 most recent audit entries affecting a user, queried by:
- `EntityType = 'User' AND EntityId = @userId` (direct entries)
- `RelatedEntityId = @userId` (related entries, e.g., team membership changes)

Each entry renders structurally as: `[timestamp] — [actor] [verb] [subject] in [team] — [description]`. Verbs are mapped per `AuditAction` in `AuditLogViewComponent.GetActionVerb`; a self-form (`GetActionSelfVerb`) is used when actor == subject to avoid dangling prepositions. Actor and subject are resolved as clickable `<human-link>` from `UserDisplayNames` (batch-loaded). Unmapped actions fall back to a rough `[actor] · [ActionName] · [subject] — [description]` form so attribution is never lost.

## Authorization

The global audit log (`/Board/AuditLog`) is visible only to Board and Admin roles — it lives on `BoardController` (`[Authorize(Roles = "Board,Admin")]`). The Finance audit log (`/Finance/AuditLog`) is restricted to FinanceAdmin and Admin. Per-resource and per-user Google sync audit views are on `GoogleController`.
