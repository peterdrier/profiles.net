# Teams & Working Groups

## Business Context

Nobodies Collective operates through self-organizing working groups (teams). Teams can be created for specific initiatives and managed by their members. Three system-managed teams automatically track key organizational roles: all volunteers, all team leaders (metaleads), and board members.

## System Teams

### Automatic Membership Sync

| Team | Auto-Add Trigger | Auto-Remove Trigger |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Volunteers** | All required docs signed | Missing consent or suspended |
| **Metaleads** | Become Metalead of any team | No longer Metalead anywhere |
| **Board** | Active "Board" RoleAssignment | RoleAssignment expires |

### System Team Properties
- `RequiresApproval = false` (auto-managed)
- Cannot be edited or deleted
- Cannot manually join or leave
- Cannot change member roles

### Sync Job
```
SystemTeamSyncJob runs hourly:
  1. SyncVolunteersTeamAsync()
     - Get all users with hasAllRequiredConsents = true
     - Add missing members, remove ineligible

  2. SyncMetaleadsTeamAsync()
     - Get all users with TeamMember.Role = Metalead
     - In non-system teams only
     - Add missing members, remove ineligible

  3. SyncBoardTeamAsync()
     - Get all users with active Board RoleAssignment
     - Where ValidFrom <= now AND (ValidTo == null OR ValidTo > now)
     - Add missing members, remove ineligible
```

## Approval Authority

### Who Can Approve Join Requests

| User Type | Can Approve |
|-----------|-------------|
| Team Metalead | Own team only |
| Board Member | Any team |
| Regular Member | No |

### Authorization Check
```csharp
bool CanApprove(teamId, userId)
{
    // Board members can approve any team
    if (IsUserBoardMember(userId)) return true;

    // Metaleads can approve their own team
    return IsUserMetaleadOfTeam(teamId, userId);
}
```

## Google Integration

When membership changes:
- **Join**: `AddUserToTeamResourcesAsync(teamId, userId)`
- **Leave**: `RemoveUserFromTeamResourcesAsync(teamId, userId)`

Currently uses `StubGoogleSyncService` that logs actions.
Real implementation will manage Google Drive folder permissions.
