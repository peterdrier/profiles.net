# Teams & Working Groups

## Business Context

Nobodies Collective operates through self-organizing working groups (teams). Teams can be created for specific initiatives and managed by their members. Three system-managed teams automatically track key organizational roles: all volunteers, all team leaders (leads), and board members.

## System Teams

### Automatic Membership Sync

| Team | Auto-Add Trigger | Auto-Remove Trigger |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Volunteers** | Approved + all required consents signed | Missing consent, suspended, or approval revoked |
| **Leads** | Become Lead of any team + team consents | No longer Lead anywhere |
| **Board** | Active "Board" RoleAssignment + team consents | RoleAssignment expires |

Volunteers team membership is the source of truth for "active volunteer" status. Both approval (`AdminController.ApproveVolunteer`) and consent completion (`ConsentController.Submit`) trigger an immediate single-user sync via `SyncVolunteersMembershipForUserAsync` — the user doesn't wait for the scheduled job.

### System Team Properties
- `RequiresApproval = false` (auto-managed)
- Cannot be edited or deleted
- Cannot manually join or leave
- Cannot change member roles

### Sync Job
```
SystemTeamSyncJob (scheduled hourly, currently disabled; also triggered inline):

  1. SyncVolunteersTeamAsync()
     - Get all users where IsApproved = true AND !IsSuspended
     - Filter to those with all required Volunteers-team consents
     - Add missing members, remove ineligible

  2. SyncLeadsTeamAsync()
     - Get all users with TeamMember.Role = Lead (non-system teams)
     - Filter by Leads-team consents
     - Add missing members, remove ineligible

  3. SyncBoardTeamAsync()
     - Get all users with active Board RoleAssignment
     - Where ValidFrom <= now AND (ValidTo == null OR ValidTo > now)
     - Filter by Board-team consents
     - Add missing members, remove ineligible

  Single-user variant: SyncVolunteersMembershipForUserAsync(userId)
     - Called by AdminController (after approval) and ConsentController (after consent)
     - Evaluates one user without affecting others
```

### Access Gating

Volunteers team membership controls app access. Non-volunteers can only access Home, Profile, Consent, Account, and Application pages. Teams, Governance, and other member features require the `ActiveMember` claim, which is granted when the user is in the Volunteers team.

## Approval Authority

### Who Can Approve Join Requests

| User Type | Can Approve |
|-----------|-------------|
| Team Lead | Own team only |
| Board Member | Any team |
| Regular Member | No |

### Authorization Check
```csharp
bool CanApprove(teamId, userId)
{
    // Board members can approve any team
    if (IsUserBoardMember(userId)) return true;

    // Leads can approve their own team
    return IsUserLeadOfTeam(teamId, userId);
}
```

## Google Integration

When membership changes:
- **Join**: `AddUserToTeamResourcesAsync(teamId, userId)`
- **Leave**: `RemoveUserFromTeamResourcesAsync(teamId, userId)`

Currently uses `StubGoogleSyncService` that logs actions.
Real implementation will manage Google Drive folder permissions.
