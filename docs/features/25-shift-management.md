# Shift Management

## Business Context

Nobodies Collective runs multi-day events (e.g., Nowhere) where volunteers are needed for shifts across departments (Gate, Bar, DPW, etc.). The shift management system lets admins configure event schedules, department coordinators create and manage shift rotas, and volunteers browse and sign up for shifts. Urgency scoring surfaces understaffed shifts to drive volunteer action.

See `docs/specs/shift-management-spec.md` for the full design specification.

## User Stories

### US-25.1: Admin Configures Event
**As an** Admin
**I want to** create and manage EventSettings (dates, timezone, EE capacity, browsing toggle)
**So that** the shift system is configured for the current event cycle

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only one active EventSettings at a time
- Configure gate opening date, build/event/strike offsets, timezone
- Set early entry capacity step function and barrios allocation
- Toggle shift browsing open/closed
- Set early entry close instant

### US-25.2: Coordinator Manages Rotas and Shifts
**As a** department coordinator
**I want to** create rotas with shifts for my department
**So that** volunteers can sign up for work slots

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create rota with name, period (Build/Event/Strike), priority (Normal/Important/Essential), signup policy (Public/RequireApproval), and optional practical info
- Toggle rota visibility (`IsVisibleToVolunteers`) — hidden rotas are excluded from volunteer browse but remain visible to coordinators/admins, enabling staged rollout of signup
- Build/strike rotas use all-day shifts with date-range signup; event rotas use time-slotted shifts
- Bulk shift creation: `CreateBuildStrikeShiftsAsync` for build/strike rotas (one all-day shift per day offset with per-day staffing), `GenerateEventShiftsAsync` for event rotas (Cartesian product of day offsets x time slots)
- Create individual shifts with day offset, start time, duration, min/max volunteers
- Mark shifts as AdminOnly to restrict to coordinators/admins
- Delete rotas/shifts (delete blocked if confirmed signups exist; no deactivate — delete is the only removal path)
- Move a rota to a different department — updates the team FK while preserving all shifts and signups; only available to coordinators/admins; recorded in the audit log (`RotaMovedToTeam`); redirects to the target team's shift admin page

### US-25.3: Volunteer Browses and Signs Up
**As a** volunteer
**I want to** browse available shifts and sign up
**So that** I can contribute to the event

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Browse shifts filtered by department and date range (From/To date pickers; either may be omitted for open-ended range)
- Filter by period (Set-up / Event / Strike toggle buttons)
- Date picker and period tabs interact cleanly: selecting a date clears the active period tab (dates take precedence); selecting a period tab clears manual dates; date picker min/max constrains to the active period's range when a period is selected
- Consecutive all-day shifts within the same rota are compressed into date ranges (e.g., "Jun 16–21, 6 days") with aggregated fill status; click to expand individual days
- Only rotas with `IsVisibleToVolunteers = true` appear (privileged users see all)
- See fill status (confirmed count vs max)
- Sign up for a shift (auto-confirmed for Public policy, pending for RequireApproval)
- Date-range signup for build/strike rotas via `SignUpRangeAsync` — creates signups for all all-day shifts in the range, linked by a shared `SignupBlockId`
- Overlap detection prevents signing up for conflicting time slots (event shifts)
- AdminOnly shifts hidden from non-privileged users
- EE freeze blocks non-privileged build shift signups after early entry close

### US-25.4: Coordinator Approves/Refuses Signups
**As a** department coordinator
**I want to** approve or refuse pending signups
**So that** I can manage who works my department's shifts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Approve re-validates overlap (returns warning, not blocker)
- Refuse with optional reason
- Batch approve/refuse: `ApproveRangeAsync`/`RefuseRangeAsync` — approves or refuses all pending signups sharing a `SignupBlockId` in one action
- Pending approvals table shows signup date and groups range signups with date range display
- Voluntell: enroll a volunteer directly (auto-confirmed, sets Enrolled flag)
- Remove: unassign a confirmed signup via `RemoveSignupAsync` — transitions to Cancelled with reviewer tracking

### US-25.5: Volunteer Manages Their Shifts
**As a** volunteer
**I want to** view my shifts and bail if needed
**So that** I can manage my schedule

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- View upcoming, pending, and past shifts on /Shifts/Mine
- Bail from confirmed or pending signups
- Range bail via `BailRangeAsync` — bails all signups sharing a `SignupBlockId` (build/strike date-range signups)
- Build shift bail blocked after EE close for non-privileged users
- Reusable `ShiftSignupsViewComponent` shows categorized signups (upcoming/pending/past) on Dashboard and HumanDetail pages

### US-25.7: Guided Shift Discovery
**As a** volunteer with no upcoming shifts
**I want to** see a guided introduction to shifts on my dashboard
**So that** I understand how to get involved

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When shift browsing is open and user has no upcoming or pending signups, Dashboard shows a discovery card
- Discovery card explains the three shift phases (Set-up, Event, Strike) with brief descriptions
- Urgent understaffed shifts are highlighted within the discovery card
- Clear CTAs to browse all shifts and view own shift schedule
- When user has existing signups, the standard shift signups component and urgent shifts list are shown instead

### US-25.8: Rota Tags and Volunteer Preferences
**As a** coordinator
**I want to** tag rotas with descriptive labels (e.g., "Heavy lifting", "Working in the sun")
**So that** volunteers can filter and find shifts matching their interests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Coordinators can add/remove tags from rotas via the shift admin page
- Tags are shared across all teams — any coordinator can use existing tags or create new ones
- Tag picker shows existing tags as checkboxes plus an inline "create new tag" field
- Tags displayed as badges on rota cards in both admin and browse views
- Initial tags seeded from coordinator feedback: Heavy lifting, Working in the sun, Working in the shade, Organisational task, Meeting new people, Looking after folks, Exploring the site, Feeding and hydrating folks

**As a** volunteer
**I want to** filter shifts by tag and set tag preferences on the browse page
**So that** I can find shifts that match the kind of work I enjoy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tag filter bar on `/Shifts` browse page — click tags to toggle filter (additive)
- Active tag filters shown as filled buttons with X to remove
- Volunteers can set preferred tags via a collapsible preferences panel on the browse page
- Shifts with matching tags are highlighted with a star icon
- Tag preferences are accessible from the browse page directly (no need to navigate to profile)

### US-25.6: Post-Event No-Show Tracking
**As a** coordinator
**I want to** mark no-shows after shifts end
**So that** reliability data is captured

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- MarkNoShow blocked before shift end time
- Sets status to NoShow with reviewer recorded

## Data Model

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `EventSettings` | Singleton event config: dates, timezone, EE capacity, browsing toggle |
| `Rota` | Shift container per department+event, with period (Build/Event/Strike), priority, signup policy, practical info, and visibility toggle (`IsVisibleToVolunteers`, default true) |
| `Shift` | Single work slot: day offset, time, duration, volunteer min/max; IsAllDay flag for build/strike shifts |
| `ShiftSignup` | User-to-shift link with state machine; SignupBlockId groups range signups |
| `GeneralAvailability` | Per-user per-event day availability (general volunteer pool) |
| `VolunteerEventProfile` | Per-event skills, dietary, medical info, email preferences |
| `ShiftTag` | Descriptive label for rotas (Id, Name); shared across all teams |
| `RotaShiftTag` | Join table: Rota ↔ ShiftTag many-to-many |
| `VolunteerTagPreference` | Links a volunteer to preferred tags for personalized recommendations |

## State Machine (ShiftSignup)

```
Pending --> Confirmed   (Approve / auto-confirm)
Pending --> Refused     (Refuse)
Pending --> Bailed      (Bail)
Confirmed --> Bailed    (Bail)
Confirmed --> NoShow    (MarkNoShow, post-shift only)
Confirmed --> Cancelled (system: shift deleted, account deletion, or coordinator removal)
Pending --> Cancelled   (system: shift deleted, account deletion)
```

## Authorization Model

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Admin | Full access: manage shifts, approve signups, bypass all restrictions |
| NoInfoAdmin | Approve/refuse signups, voluntell; cannot create/edit shifts or rotas |
| Dept Coordinator | Manage rotas/shifts for own department, approve/refuse signups |
| Volunteer | Browse shifts, sign up, bail, view own schedule |

## Urgency Scoring

`score = remainingSlots * priorityWeight * durationHours * understaffedMultiplier * proximityBoost`

- Priority weights: Normal=1, Important=3, Essential=6
- Understaffed multiplier: 2x when confirmed < minVolunteers, else 1x
- Proximity boost: `1 + 10 / (1 + daysUntilStart)` — today ~11x, tomorrow ~6x, 7 days ~2.25x, 30 days ~1.3x
- Score=0 when fully staffed (remaining=0)
- **Period diversity (homepage top-N):** When a limit is applied (e.g., homepage top 3), the system reserves one slot per non-Build period (Event, Strike) that has eligible shifts. This prevents build shifts from monopolizing the homepage even when they have more total slots. Remaining slots are filled from the overall top scorers.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/Shifts` | Browse all shifts (filtered by department, date range, period, tags) |
| `/Shifts/Mine` | View own signups (upcoming, pending, past) |
| `/Shifts/Preferences/Tags` | POST: Save volunteer tag preferences |
| `/Shifts/Settings` | Admin: manage EventSettings |
| `/Teams/{slug}/Shifts` | Coordinator: manage rotas/shifts for a department |
| `/` (Dashboard) | Shift signups ViewComponent + guided discovery when no signups |
| `/Human/{id}/Admin` | Shift signups ViewComponent (admin view of user's shifts) |

## Coordinator Dashboard

**Purpose:** Give Volunteer Coordinators, NoInfoAdmins, and Admins a single cross-department view that answers the weekly coordination questions: is overall staffing tracking toward the event, which departments are behind, which coordinator teams have stale pending signups, and are new signups / ticket sales trending.

**Route:** `/Shifts/Dashboard` (existing) — the four dashboard panels render above the legacy urgent-shifts filter.

**Panels:**

- **Overview counters** — five cards: shifts filled (with per-period Build/Event/Strike fill chips coloured ≥80% green / 60–79% amber / <60% red), ticket holders, ticket holding volunteers (primary-bordered emphasis card; sub-line shows how many ticket-holding humans haven't signed up), non-ticket signups, stale pending (warning-bordered when > 0).
- **Departments table** — one row per parent team, sorted by ascending fill %. Clicking a row expands to either three period sub-rows (Build/Event/Strike) when the department has no subteams, or a subgroup table showing each subteam (plus a "Direct" row for rotas attached to the parent itself) with per-period fill % chips.
- **Coordinator activity** — teams that have ≥1 pending signup, one row each listing coordinator names, oldest login across that team's coordinators (rendered red if > 7 days or never), and pending signup count. Hidden entirely if no team has pending signups.
- **Trends chart** — line chart with three series (new signups, new ticket sales, distinct logins / DAU) over a selectable window (7/30/90 days, All). Window toggle re-renders via `asp-route-trendWindow=`. DAU series is dashed with a tooltip noting that only the last login per human is stored (older buckets undercount).
- **Urgency accordion** — one collapsible item per (Rota, Department) summarising slot coverage across all matching shifts (total confirmed / min–max, day count, priority). Expand to see per-day rows; the per-row Voluntell action is gated by `ShiftDashboardAccess` so subteam managers (when the page is reached via the wider `ShiftDepartmentManager` policy) see the rows but no action column.

**Filter (Period vs Date Range — mutually exclusive):**

- **Period buttons** — All / Set-up (Build) / Event / Strike. When Set-up is selected, a second segmented row appears underneath: **All set-up / First crew / Set-up week / Pre-event week / Finishing weekend**, defaulting to "All set-up". Sub-period boundaries are configurable per event via four offset fields on `EventSettings` (`FirstCrewStartOffset`, `SetupWeekStartOffset`, `PreEventWeekStartOffset`, `FinishingWeekendStartOffset` — default `-25 / -16 / -9 / -4`).
- **Date range** — start + end inputs. End-date input enforces `min = startDate` so the user cannot pick an end before the start. Either input can be left blank (start-only = "from this date onwards", end-only = "up to this date"). Active range is reflected in a "Showing DD MMM – DD MMM YYYY" banner under the form.
- **Mutex semantics:**
  - Picking a period or sub-period button **auto-populates the date inputs** with that range as a visual cue. The server still uses period+sub-period as the canonical filter; dates are display-only in this case.
  - Manually editing a date input clears the period+sub-period hidden inputs (period/sub-period buttons revert to unselected). The date range becomes the active filter.
  - Server defends the same mutex: when both a period and dates arrive on a single request, period wins for filtering and dates round-trip back to the inputs without being applied as bounds.

**Metric definitions:**

- **Shift filled** — confirmed signup count ≥ `MinVolunteers`.
- **Period fill rate** — filled shifts in the period / total shifts in the period, expressed as a percentage. Aggregates ignore AdminOnly shifts' visibility.
- **Ticket holder** — a human with an active ticket for the event.
- **Ticket holding volunteer** — a ticket holder who has at least one shift signup on a visible, non-AdminOnly shift of this event, with any status other than `Cancelled`. Pending, Refused, Bailed, and NoShow all count as "engaged with the shift system", so the metric is "ticket holders we've gotten in front of", not "currently committed to work a shift".
- **Non-ticket signup** — distinct humans who have ≥1 non-bailed/non-refused/non-cancelled signup but no active ticket.
- **Stale pending** — a pending signup whose `CreatedAt` is more than 3 days ago.
- **Subgroup aggregate invariant** — department totals equal the sum of subgroup totals (including the synthetic "Direct" row for rotas whose team is the parent itself).
- **DAU** — distinct humans whose last login falls on the bucket date in the event timezone. Limitation: the system stores only the most recent login per human, so older buckets are biased low.

**Authorization:** Controller action is gated by `[Authorize(Policy = PolicyNames.ShiftDashboardAccess)]` → Admin, NoInfoAdmin, VolunteerCoordinator. The service (`IShiftManagementService`) is auth-free per `design-rules.md`.

**Caching:** Each dashboard query memoizes into `IMemoryCache` with a 5-minute sliding expiration. Keys:

- `dashboard-overview:{eventSettingsId}`
- `dashboard-coordinator-activity:{eventSettingsId}`
- `dashboard-trends:{eventSettingsId}:{window}`

At ~500-human scale, the dashboard view hits the cache on most loads and the underlying aggregation queries only run on first visit per coordinator per 5 minutes. Signup mutations do NOT currently invalidate these caches — counters lag real state by up to 5 minutes after approving, refusing, bailing, or creating signups (tracked as a follow-up; see the dashboard spec).

**Development seeder:** `DevelopmentDashboardSeeder` populates a realistic demo dataset (one event, several departments including one with subteams, ticket holders with mixed signup states, pending signups of varying ages, and ~85 days of spread signup/ticket/login activity for the trend chart). Exposed at `POST /dev/seed/dashboard`, button rendered on `/Shifts/Dashboard` only when the app is running in the Development environment. Not reachable in QA / preview / production regardless of role.
