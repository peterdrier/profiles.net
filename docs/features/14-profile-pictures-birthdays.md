# Profile Pictures & Birthday Calendar

## Business Context

Members need a way to personalize their profiles beyond the Google OAuth avatar. Custom profile pictures make team pages more personal and help members recognize each other. The birthday calendar fosters community by letting members see upcoming birthdays within the organization.

## Data Model

### Profile Entity (additions)
```
Profile
├── DateOfBirth: LocalDate? [PersonalData]
├── ProfilePictureData: byte[]? [PersonalData]
└── ProfilePictureContentType: string? (100)
```

### Computed Properties
```
Profile.HasCustomProfilePicture: bool (computed, not mapped)
  → ProfilePictureData != null && ProfilePictureData.Length > 0
```

### Storage Approach
Profile pictures are stored as `bytea` in PostgreSQL. This is appropriate for the ~500 member scale of this organization. The dedicated `Picture` endpoint uses EF projection to load only the picture data columns, avoiding loading the full Profile entity.

## Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `GET /Profile/Picture/{id}` | GET | Serve profile picture (anonymous, cached 1hr) |
| `GET /Teams/Birthdays` | GET | Birthday calendar (current month) |
| `GET /Teams/Birthdays?month=N` | GET | Birthday calendar for specific month |

```

## Picture Priority

Custom uploaded picture always takes precedence over Google OAuth avatar. This is implemented via the `EffectiveProfilePictureUrl` computed property on both `ProfileViewModel` and `TeamMemberViewModel`:

```
EffectiveProfilePictureUrl = HasCustomProfilePicture
    ? CustomProfilePictureUrl   (→ /Profile/Picture/{id})
    : ProfilePictureUrl         (→ Google avatar URL)
```

## Privacy Model

| Data | Member | Other Members | Board |
|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Profile picture | Yes | Yes (in teams) | Yes |
| Date of birth (full) | Yes | No | Yes |
| Birthday (month+day) | Yes | Yes (calendar) | Yes |
