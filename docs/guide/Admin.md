# Admin

## What this section is for

The Admin section is the global control panel: managing humans (suspending, approving, assigning roles, purging in non-production), configuring Google sync, reading the audit log, triaging the notification inbox, and running technical operations like configuration review, in-memory logs, database version, cache and query stats, and Hangfire lock cleanup.

Admin is layered. **Board** and **HumanAdmin** can do human management — the list, detail, role assignments, suspend/unsuspend, approve, reject. **Admin** is the superset and additionally owns technical operations, sync settings, duplicate-account resolution, and workspace-account provisioning. Domain admins like Teams Admin, Camp Admin, and Ticket Admin are separate roles covered in their own section guides.

## Key pages at a glance

- `/Admin` — Admin Tools menu with System Operations and Quick Links columns.
- `/Board` — dashboard with cards for Total Humans, Active, Pending Approval, Missing Consents, Suspended, and Pending Deletion, plus a recent-activity feed and links to pending volunteers, pending applications, and the audit log. Visible to Board and Admin.
- `/Profile/Admin` — humans list; `?filter=pending` scopes to pending approvals.
- `/Profile/{id}/Admin` — per-human detail, with suspend, unsuspend, approve, reject, add role, end role.
- `/Profile/{id}/Admin/Outbox` — per-human email outbox.
- `/AuditLog` — global audit log, filterable and paginated.
- `/Notifications` — your notification inbox.
- `/Google/SyncSettings` — per-service sync mode (Admin only).
- `/Admin/Configuration`, `/Admin/Logs`, `/Admin/DbStats`, `/Admin/CacheStats`, `/Admin/DbVersion` — technical diagnostics.
- `/Admin/ClearHangfireLocks` — clear stuck job locks (Admin only; requires restart).
- `/Admin/DuplicateAccounts` and `/Admin/MergeRequests` — duplicate detection and merge flow.
- `/Admin/Humans/{id}/Purge` — permanent delete, disabled in production.
- `/hangfire` — Hangfire dashboard, Admin only.

## As a Volunteer

Admin pages are not visible to you.

## As a Coordinator

The Coordinator role does not include global admin access; the domain-specific admin roles (Teams Admin, Camp Admin, Ticket Admin, Finance Admin, Feedback Admin, and so on) are separate and covered in their respective section guides.

## As a Board member / Admin

### Work the dashboard

Open `/Board` for the dashboard. The cards at the top — Total Humans, Active, Pending Approval, Missing Consents, Suspended, Pending Deletion — double as entry points, and a Pending Volunteers / Pending Applications action panel sits below. The recent-activity feed shows the latest audit entries so you can see what the system and other admins have been doing. `/Admin` is a separate Admin Tools menu of system operations and quick links rather than a dashboard.

### Manage humans

Open `/Profile/Admin`. Search by name or email, filter pending volunteers with `?filter=pending`, and click through to a human's detail page. From there you can:

- **Approve** a pending volunteer. Approval, combined with all required consents signed, immediately adds the human to the Volunteers team and grants the ActiveMember claim — no wait for the hourly sync.
- **Reject** a signup. Audited, and the human is notified.
- **Suspend** or **Unsuspend**. Suspension requires a note; it revokes Google Workspace access on the next sync and ends current memberships. Unsuspension clears the flag and re-queues access.
- **Add role** or **End role**. Role assignments are temporal — valid-from plus optional valid-to — and every change is audited. **Admin** can assign any role. **Board** and **HumanAdmin** can assign any role **except** Admin. The first Admin must be seeded directly in the database.

Every human-admin action writes an audit entry with your user as the actor.

### Read the audit log

`/AuditLog` shows every audit entry — role changes, suspensions, team join decisions, Google sync events, tier application decisions, anomalous Drive permission changes, workspace-account lifecycle, and more. Filter buttons scope to Anomalous Permissions, Access Granted/Revoked, Suspensions, and Roles. The log is **append-only** — database triggers prevent update and delete — and deleted humans show as "Deleted User" rather than disappearing from the trail. Per-human and per-resource audit views are also linked from the human and resource detail pages.

### Triage the notification inbox

`/Notifications` is your shared "what needs my attention" view. Actionable notifications targeted at the Admin role (sync errors, consent reviews, tier application submissions) appear under **Needs attention**. When a group notification targets all Admins or all Coordinators of a team, **any recipient can resolve it for all** — the resolver's name is shown so no one duplicates work. Informational notifications (team changes, workspace credentials ready, drift fixes) fall under **Recent**. The bell icon shows a red count for actionable items and a green dot for informational-only.

### Configure Google sync

`/Google/SyncSettings` (Admin only) sets each Google service to **None**, **AddOnly**, or **AddAndRemove**. **None** is a fast kill switch — no redeploy — that turns off both the scheduled jobs (hourly team sync, daily 03:00 reconciliation) and manual Sync Now for that service. See [GoogleIntegration](GoogleIntegration.md) for the full Google surface.

### Run technical operations (Admin only)

- **Configuration** (`/Admin/Configuration`) lists every auto-discovered setting, classified as critical, recommended, or optional, with sensitive values masked. The feedback API key is set here and enables the in-app feedback submission flow described in [Feedback](Feedback.md).
- **Logs** (`/Admin/Logs`) shows recent in-memory Serilog entries for quick triage without shelling in.
- **DbStats**, **CacheStats**, **DbVersion** report query statistics, cache hit/miss rates, and applied and pending EF migrations.
- **ClearHangfireLocks** removes stuck background-job locks; the app must be restarted afterwards to re-register recurring jobs.
- **Hangfire dashboard** (`/hangfire`) is Admin-only for inspecting and re-queueing jobs.

### Resolve duplicate accounts

`/Admin/DuplicateAccounts` scans for humans whose email addresses overlap across `User.Email` and `UserEmail.Email`, with Gmail / Googlemail equivalence. Review a candidate, then archive the duplicate and re-link its logins. Pending merge requests live at `/Admin/MergeRequests`; accepting one consolidates all associated data onto the surviving account.

### Purge (non-production only)

`/Admin/Humans/{id}/Purge` permanently deletes a human and all associated data, severing the OAuth link so the next Google login creates a fresh account. Purge is **disabled in production**, and you cannot purge your own account.
