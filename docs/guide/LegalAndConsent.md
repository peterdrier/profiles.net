# Legal & Consent

## What this section is for

Legal & Consent is how the collective keeps its paperwork honest. Every [human](Glossary.md#human) who joins agrees to a small set of legal documents, and every agreement is recorded with a timestamp, a content hash, and the IP and device you consented from. This lets the org operate under GDPR in Spain and the EU: explicit, auditable, reversible at your request.

This section also surfaces your two core GDPR rights: a copy of everything the org holds about you (Article 15), and account deletion (Article 17).

## Key pages at a glance

- **Your consents** (`/Consent`) — any signed-in human reviews documents they've signed and re-signs when versions change.
- **My Data** (`/Profile/Me/Privacy`) — Download my Data (Article 15) and Account Deletion (Article 17).
- **Statutes** (`/Legal`) — anyone, including signed-out visitors, reads the association's current statutes (pulled directly from GitHub).
- **Onboarding review queue** (`/OnboardingReview`) — [Consent Coordinator](Glossary.md#consent-coordinator), [Volunteer Coordinator](Glossary.md#volunteer-coordinator), [Board](Glossary.md#board), and [Admin](Glossary.md#admin) view humans awaiting activation; only Consent Coordinator, Board, and Admin can clear, flag, or reject.
- **Manage documents** (`/Legal/Admin/Documents`) — Board and Admin create, edit, archive, and publish legal documents.

## As a [Volunteer](Glossary.md#volunteer)

**Signing your consents.** When you first sign in, you'll see documents grouped by team. The Volunteers team's documents apply to everyone; team-specific ones appear once you join that team. Open each document, read it, and tick the explicit consent checkbox. Tabs let you switch between languages — Spanish (Castellano) is always the canonical, legally binding version; other tabs are marked as translations. The checkbox is never pre-ticked.

**Your signed consent is a permanent record.** Once you tick the box, the system writes an immutable entry: which document version, when, from what IP and browser, and a hash of the exact text you agreed to. Nobody — not Admin, not the database owner — can alter or remove it. This is what makes the audit trail trustworthy, and what protects you in any dispute about what you agreed to.

**Viewing your consent history.** From `/Consent` you can see every document you've signed, its version, and whether it's still current. If a document has been updated, you'll see an "Action required" badge and will need to re-sign. There's a per-document grace period (seven days by default) before a missing re-consent affects your team membership.

**Downloading your data (Article 15).** From your profile, use "Download my data" to get a JSON file containing everything the system holds about you: profile, contact fields, consents, team memberships, shift sign-ups, tickets, feedback, audit entries. Self-service, no request ticket.

**Requesting account deletion (Article 17).** From your profile, use "Delete my account." Your team memberships are revoked immediately, so you stop showing up in rosters and Google Groups. The data purge runs as a background job shortly after. A few records are kept as required by law (consent records, append-only audit entries), but personal identifiers on those are scrubbed or rewritten to a placeholder.

## As a Coordinator (Consent Coordinator)

Consent Coordinators are the safety gate between "this human signed the paperwork" and "this human is an active volunteer."

**Reviewing the queue.** Open `/OnboardingReview`. Every human who has signed all required global documents lands here in Pending state. Open a record to see their signed documents, versions, and timestamps.

**Clearing or flagging.** Two actions:

- **Clear** — the human is auto-approved as a Volunteer, added to the Volunteers system team, and granted the active-member claim that unlocks the rest of the app.
- **Flag** — activation is blocked pending Board or Admin review. Flag when something looks off and leave a note so Board can pick it up.

Coordinators cannot edit legal documents or publish new versions — that's a Board or Admin function.

## As a Board member / Admin

**Managing documents.** `/Legal/Admin/Documents` lists every legal document. Each belongs to a team (Volunteers = applies to everyone), has a configurable grace period (default 7 days), and can be linked to a GitHub folder for version-controlled editing. You can create, edit, archive, and trigger manual syncs. The only field you can change on a past version is its changes summary.

**Publishing a new version.** When the canonical Spanish file's commit SHA changes in GitHub, the next sync job (or a manual sync from the document's edit page) creates a new version automatically. Every non-initial version is flagged as requiring re-consent — humans on the affected team are notified and their consent status returns to "action required" until they sign. Old consent entries stay in the audit trail forever.

**Flagged queue.** Flagged checks from Consent Coordinators land back in the same `/OnboardingReview` queue. Resolve by clearing the human or rejecting their signup.
