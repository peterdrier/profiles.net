# Getting Started

This page walks you through your first session in the Humans app: signing up, completing your profile, consenting to the legal documents, and finding your way around. Four steps take you from a new account to an active [Volunteer](Glossary.md#volunteer) with the full app unlocked: sign up, complete your profile, consent to the legal documents, and wait for a [Consent Coordinator](Glossary.md#consent-coordinator) to clear you. Everything on this page is self-service; the only place another [human](Glossary.md#human) gets involved is the safety check at the end.

## 1. Sign up

Go to `/Account/Login`. You have two ways in:

- **Sign in with Google.** Your display name and picture come across automatically. If your email was already imported from a mailing list, Google sign-in claims that existing record rather than creating a duplicate.
- **Email me a login link.** Type your address and the system mails you a one-time magic link that expires in 15 minutes. If you do not have an account yet, the same flow creates one and asks you to pick a display name.

If you land on `/GuestDashboard`, that means you are signed in but have no profile yet — step 2 is next. The full signup pipeline is documented in [Onboarding](Onboarding.md). Can't get in, or stuck on the login link? See [Signing in & getting unstuck](SigningIn.md).

## 2. Complete your profile

Open `/Profile/Me/Edit` (the Home dashboard also nudges you here via its Getting Started checklist). You fill in:

- Your name, pronouns, city, country, bio, and birthday (month and day).
- A profile picture, if you want one that is not your Google avatar.
- Any contact fields you want to share — Phone, Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, or a custom "Other" handle. Each field has its own **visibility** setting: Board only, Coordinators and Board, My teams, or All active humans. Pick per field; the default is All active humans.
- An emergency contact (optional, recommended).
- Your skills and shift preferences (you'll be nudged through `/Profile/Me/ShiftInfo` separately). **Fill these in honestly and fully** — coordinators search by skill to find the right person for a role, so a thin profile is harder to place.

During this one-shot setup there is also a tier selector. Leave it on **Volunteer** unless you specifically want to apply for Colaborador or Asociado — those are separate tier applications reviewed by the Board and they never block your Volunteer access. Details in [Profiles](Profiles.md).

## 3. Consent to legal documents

Go to `/Consent`. You see the documents that apply to everyone, grouped by the Volunteers team. Open each one, read it, pick your language tab if you want (Castellano is always the canonical legally binding version; other languages are marked as translations), and tick the explicit consent checkbox — it is never pre-ticked.

Your signature is written as an immutable record: the document version, a hash of the exact text, the timestamp, your IP, and your browser. Nobody can edit or delete that entry afterwards — not Admin, not the database owner. That is what makes the audit trail worth something.

Once every required document is signed, your safety check automatically flips to **Pending** and a Consent Coordinator is notified. Profile completion and consent run in parallel — you can do them in either order. See [Legal and Consent](LegalAndConsent.md) for the full picture.

## 4. You're a Volunteer

A Consent Coordinator reviews your profile and either **clears** it or **flags** it. Clearing is the common path — flagging pauses onboarding until a Board member or Admin resolves the note the coordinator left.

When your profile is cleared **and** every required document is signed, the app does the rest automatically: you are added to the Volunteers system team, the rest of the app unlocks, and a welcome notification appears in the app. No manual Board step is needed.

If an Admin has provisioned a `@nobodies.team` Google Workspace account for you, you also get a credentials email at your personal address with a temporary password and a 2FA setup prompt. That address then becomes your Google service email for every team you join. Teams with linked Google Groups or [Shared Drive](Glossary.md#shared-drive) folders grant you access on the next sync. See [Your `@nobodies.team` email](EmailAccount.md) for how the mailbox works and how to use your team's group address, and [Two-step verification (2FA)](TwoStepVerification.md) for that required sign-in step. [Email](Email.md) and [Google Integration](GoogleIntegration.md) cover the fuller reference and the sync mechanics underneath.

## Where to go next

### If you're a Volunteer

- [Teams](Teams.md) — browse the directory and join a team, or request to join one that requires approval.
- [Shifts](Shifts.md) — sign up for shifts once you are on a team that runs them.
- [Profiles](Profiles.md) — add more email addresses, set communication preferences, tune contact-field visibility, export your data, or request deletion.

### If you're a [Coordinator](Glossary.md#coordinator)

- [Teams](Teams.md) — approve join requests, manage members, edit your department's public page, define role slots.
- [Shifts](Shifts.md) — schedule humans on your team's rotas.
- [Budget](Budget.md) — propose line items for your team's category, if budget access is in scope for your role.

### If you're a [Board](Glossary.md#board) member or [Admin](Glossary.md#admin)

- [Governance](Governance.md) — Colaborador and Asociado tier applications, Board votes, role assignments.
- [Admin](Admin.md) — global tools, audit log, sync settings, the flagged-safety-check queue.
- [Budget](Budget.md) — fiscal-year planning, category approvals, and the budget audit trail.
