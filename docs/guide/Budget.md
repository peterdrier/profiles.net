# Budget

## What this section is for

Budget plans and tracks money across a fiscal year — the single source of truth for allocations, actuals, and audit history. Every change is recorded in an append-only audit log.

The structure is four fixed levels:

```
Budget Year ("2026", "2027-A", ...)
  -> Budget Group ("Departments", "Site Infrastructure", "Admin", ...)
        -> Budget Category ("Cantina", "Sound", "Art", ...)
              -> Budget Line Item ("Food", "PA Rental", ...)
```

Allocations live on the category; line items are the free-text breakdown. Positive amounts are income, negative expense. All amounts are entered **VAT/IVA-inclusive** — the gross figure actually paid or received; the VAT rate (0 / 10 / 21 %) only records the IVA portion (for projecting settlement about six weeks after the end of its quarter) and is never added on top of the amount you enter.

Only one Budget Year can be **Active** at a time. Years progress **Draft -> Active -> Closed**. Archived years are hidden from non-admin views but their audit history is preserved.

## Key pages at a glance

- `/Budget/Summary` — public summary: doughnut charts, total cards, utilisation bar. Every authenticated human.
- `/Budget` — coordinator view: non-restricted department budgets with inline line-item editing where you have access.
- `/Finance` — consolidated Finance index: accordion, summary cards, charts. FinanceAdmin and Admin only.
- `/Finance/CashFlow` — weekly or monthly cash-flow projection. FinanceAdmin and Admin only.
- Category and line-item editors open from the accordion via **Manage Line Items**; the audit log (filtered by year) from the Finance toolbar.

## As a Volunteer

### See where the money goes

Open `/Budget/Summary`. You see the Active Budget Year with Total Income / Total Expenses / Net Balance cards and **Income** and **Expenses** doughnut charts by category (absolute values; when the year projects a surplus, the expenses chart also shows Cash Reserves and Spanish Taxes slices), each backed by a breakdown table.

Line-item detail and individual ticketing line items are never exposed here. Restricted groups (e.g. salaries) and ticketing both fold into the category-level aggregates.

If you coordinate a team or are a Finance Admin / Admin, a **Department Detail** link to `/Budget` appears at the top.

## As a Coordinator

(assumes Volunteer knowledge)

If you coordinate a team linked to a budget category, you have edit rights on that category's line items — nothing more.

### See your department's budget

Open `/Budget`. You see every non-ticketing group and its categories — coordinators see peer departments for context. Each category shows allocated amount, line-item total, unallocated remainder, and an expenditure-type badge.

Restricted groups (typically the Admin group holding staff and meeting costs) appear with a **Restricted** badge — you can see the group name and category names but cannot drill in. Ticketing groups are hidden from this view entirely; ticketing only shows up as summary aggregates in `/Budget/Summary`.

### Add, edit, and remove line items

Inside a category linked to a team you coordinate, use **Add Line Item** or inline edit controls. Each line item has a description, an amount entered VAT/IVA-inclusive (positive income, negative expense — enter the gross figure, do not subtract VAT), an optional expected date that feeds the cash-flow projection, a VAT rate, an optional responsible team, and optional notes.

Every edit is audit-logged. You cannot change the category's allocated amount or CapEx / OpEx flag — those belong to FinanceAdmin. Coordinator access follows child teams: if you coordinate a department, you can edit line items on its sub-teams' categories too.

### Track actuals against your plan

Each category shows budget vs actual with the unallocated remainder. Auto-generated line items (weekly ticket-sales rollups, for example) are marked **Auto** on a lighter row — don't edit those by hand; they are overwritten on the next sync.

## As a Board member / Admin (Finance Admin)

(assumes Coordinator knowledge)

Financial structure, year lifecycle, restricted groups, and the audit log live with FinanceAdmin and Admin. Board sees the full budget — restricted groups and salaries included — for oversight, and approves the total; day-to-day editing is done by FinanceAdmin.

**FinanceAdmin is the app's Treasurer role.** Assignments live on the human detail page (see [Governance](Governance.md)) and are granted by Board or Admin.

### Create and structure a Budget Year

From the `/Finance/Admin` page use **Create Budget Year**. On creation, a **Departments** group is auto-populated with one category per team flagged `HasBudget`, and a **Ticketing** group is auto-created with two starter categories (**Ticket Revenue** and **Processing Fees**) plus a zero-defaulted projection row. Neither auto-created group is marked Restricted — create a Restricted group manually (typically named "Admin") if you need to keep salary and meeting lines out of coordinator and public drill-in views.

Add further groups and categories from the Finance year detail. Categories carry a CapEx / OpEx flag (default OpEx) and an optional linked team — that link drives coordinator edit rights. If you add a budget-flagged team later, use **Sync Departments** to generate a category for any team with `HasBudget` that does not already have one in the Departments group. If you create a year without ticketing or remove the ticketing group, **Add Ticketing Group** on the year detail re-creates it.

### Lock or unlock a year

A year moves **Draft -> Active -> Closed**. Only one is Active at a time. Closing locks the year — views still work but it is read-only. Archived (soft-deleted) years vanish from non-admin views but remain in the audit log filter; no data is ever hard-deleted.

### Configure the ticketing projection

On the Ticketing group's panel, open **Projection Parameters** to set event start, event date, initial sales count, daily sales rate, average ticket price, VAT rate, and Stripe / TicketTailor fees. Saving rebuilds projected weekly revenue and per-week Stripe / TicketTailor fee lines through to the event date (VAT settles automatically in the cash-flow view from each line's VAT rate — it is not stored as its own line item). The ticketing sync job (`TicketingBudgetSyncJob`, daily at 04:30 cron `30 4 * * *`) materialises completed ISO weeks of actual sales into auto-generated line items and refreshes the remaining-week projections in the same pass; **Sync Actuals** on the year detail triggers it manually.

### Watch cash flow

`/Finance/CashFlow` aggregates line items by week or month and shows income, expenses, net, and cumulative net, with per-period category breakdown. Items without an expected date appear under **Unscheduled**. Restricted groups and cash-flow-only items (such as ticket-buyer donations) are included — this is the solvency view, not the P&L view.

### Review the audit log

Reachable from the Finance toolbar, filtered by Budget Year. Append-only — entries cannot be edited or deleted, even by Admin.
