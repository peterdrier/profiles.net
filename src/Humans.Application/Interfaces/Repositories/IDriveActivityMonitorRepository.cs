/// Repository for the persistent state owned by the Drive Activity monitor:
/// the per-job "last run at" marker (stored in <c>system_settings</c> under a

/// email via the ASP.NET Identity login tables.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The <c>system_settings</c> table is shared across services, but each
/// consumer owns its own key-space: this repository only reads and writes
/// <c>DriveActivityMonitor:LastRunAt</c>. Other keys remain owned by their
/// respective services (e.g. <c>EmailOutboxService</c>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Anomaly audit entries are persisted here rather than through
/// <c>IAuditLogService</c> so the write is atomic with the marker advance —
/// the pre-§15 implementation relied on a shared Scoped <c>DbContext</c> to
/// get that guarantee. <c>IAuditLogService</c> will migrate to the §15 pattern
/// under issue #552; at that point this method can delegate to it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The Identity login / user read is a cross-section fallback used only when
/// the Directory API can't resolve a <c>people/{id}</c>. It returns the
/// <c>User.Email</c> (OAuth primary email) directly rather than going through
/// <c>IUserService</c> so the query stays a single join — matching the
