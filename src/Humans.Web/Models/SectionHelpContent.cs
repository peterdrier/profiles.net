            ## How Teams Work

            Teams are how Nobodies Collective organises humans around shared interests and responsibilities. Every active human can browse teams and request to join.

            ### Joining a Team

            1. Browse the **Teams** page to see all available teams
            2. Click on a team to view its details and current members
            3. Click **Join** to become a member
            4. Some teams are managed — a coordinator may review your request

            ### Team Roles

            - **Member** — standard team participant
            - **Coordinator** — manages the team, can add/remove members and assign roles

            ### What Happens Automatically

            - When you join a team that has a **Google Group**, you are automatically added to that group
            - When you leave a team, you are automatically removed from the linked Google Group
            - When you join a team that has a **Shared Drive**, you are granted access automatically
            - Team changes sync to Google resources hourly via the background sync job

            ### Searching for Humans

            Use the **Search** button to find humans across all teams by name or email. The **Roster** view shows all active humans in a flat list. The **Map** shows humans by location. **Birthdays** shows upcoming celebrations.
            """,

        ["Profile"] = """
            ## Your Profile

            Your profile is how other humans in the collective see you. Keep it up to date so people can find and contact you.

            ### Completing Your Profile

            1. Add your **display name** — this is how you appear across the system
            2. Upload a **photo** so humans can recognise you
            3. Set your **birthday** (month and day) — the collective celebrates birthdays together
            4. Add **contact fields** (phone, social media, etc.) with visibility controls

            ### Contact Visibility

            Each contact field has a visibility level that controls who can see it:

            - **All active humans** — visible to every active member
            - **My teams** — visible only to humans on the same teams as you
            - **Coordinators & Board** — visible only to team coordinators and the Board
            - **Board only** — visible only to Board members

            ### What Happens Automatically

            - When your profile is complete and consents are signed, you become an **active human**
            - Active humans are added to the **Volunteers** team automatically
            - Your Google Workspace access is provisioned based on your team memberships

        ["Admin"] = """
            ## Admin Tools

            The Admin section provides system-wide management tools for administrators.

            ### System Operations

            - **Configuration Status** — view current system configuration and environment settings
            - **Sync Settings** — control Google sync behaviour per service (None / Add Only / Add and Remove)
            - **Email Outbox** — view and manage outbound emails
            - **Background Jobs** — monitor Hangfire job status and history

            ### Human Management

            - **All Humans** — browse and search all registered humans
            - **Role Assignments** — manage governance and system role assignments with temporal tracking
            - **Legal Documents** — manage consent documents and their versions

            ### Google Integration

            - **System Team Sync** — runs hourly, syncs team memberships to Google Groups and Shared Drives
            - **Reconciliation** — runs daily at 03:00, detects drift between expected and actual Google permissions

            ### What Happens Automatically

            - Hourly sync keeps Google Groups and Drive permissions in sync with team memberships
            - Daily reconciliation reports any permission drift for manual review
            - Email notifications are sent for role assignment changes

        ["Shifts"] = """
            ## How Shifts Work

            Shifts are time slots that need to be staffed during events. Humans can browse available shifts, sign up, and manage their availability.

            ### Signing Up for Shifts

            1. Browse available shifts on the **Shifts** page
            2. Filter by date, department, or shift type to find what suits you
            3. Click on a shift to see details and sign up
            4. Some shifts require coordinator approval before your signup is confirmed

            ### Managing Your Shifts

            - Use **My Shifts** to see everything you have signed up for
            - You can withdraw from a shift before it starts (unless the coordinator has locked signups)

            ### Shift Phases

            Shifts are grouped by event phase:

            - **Set-up** — before the event, building and preparing
            - **Event** — during the event itself
            - **Strike** — after the event, teardown and cleanup

            ### For Coordinators

            - Create and manage **rotas** (recurring shift patterns)
            - Approve or refuse signups for your department
            - **Voluntell** — directly assign a human to a shift
            - View the **Staffing Dashboard** for an overview of coverage

            ### What Happens Automatically

            - Confirmation emails are sent when your signup is approved
            - Reminder notifications are sent before your shift starts

        ["Camps"] = """
            ## How Barrios Work

            Barrios are themed villages or spaces at events. Any human can register a barrio, and barrio admins approve them for the event.

            ### Registering a Barrio

            1. Go to the **Barrios** page
            2. Click **Register a Barrio**
            3. Fill in barrio details: name, description, theme, requirements
            4. Submit for review — a barrio admin will approve or request changes

            ### Barrio Lifecycle

            1. **Draft** — you are building your barrio registration
            2. **Submitted** — awaiting admin review
            3. **Approved** — your barrio is confirmed for the event
            4. **Rejected** — admin has declined (with feedback)

            ### Barrio Leads

            The human who registers a barrio becomes the **Barrio Lead**. Barrio leads can:

            - Edit their barrio details
            - Manage barrio members and roles
            - Update barrio status and requirements

            ### What Happens Automatically

            - Barrio admins are notified when new barrios are submitted for review
            - Barrio leads are notified when their barrio is approved or rejected
            """,

        ["Governance"] = """
            ## Governance & Tiers

            Nobodies Collective has a tiered membership structure defined in the estatutos (bylaws). All humans start as **Volunteers**. Those who want more involvement can apply for higher tiers.

            ### Membership Tiers

            - **Volunteer** — the standard member. Can participate in teams, shifts, and camps
            - **Colaborador** — active contributor with project/event responsibilities. 2-year term
            - **Asociado** — voting member with governance rights (assemblies, elections). 2-year term

            ### Applying for a Tier

            1. Go to the **Governance** page
            2. Review the estatutos to understand the responsibilities
            3. Click **Apply** and select the tier you want
            4. The Board reviews your application and votes
            5. You are notified of the outcome

            ## Onboarding Review

            The onboarding review queue shows new humans who have signed up and need their consent documents reviewed before becoming active.

            ### Review Process

            1. New humans sign up, complete their profile, and consent to legal documents
            2. A **Consent Coordinator** reviews the consent submissions
            3. If everything is in order, the coordinator **clears** the human
            4. The human automatically becomes active and is added to the Volunteers team

            - **Flag** — mark a signup for further review (e.g., incomplete information)
            - **Reject** — decline a signup (with reason)

            ### What Happens Automatically

            The Container Placement Map lets barrio leads and Map Admins drag shipping containers onto the festival site map and lock in their positions.

            ### Placing a Container

            1. Find an unplaced container in the **Unplaced** list on the left sidebar
            2. Click it — a blue pentagon appears at your barrio's centre
            3. Drag the container to the exact position you want
            4. Release to auto-save — the card moves to the **Placed** list

            ### Adjusting Position

            Click a placed container card in the sidebar (or click the orange polygon on the map) to select it, then drag to reposition. Every drag-release auto-saves.

            ### Rotating a Container

            When a container is active (blue), a small blue handle appears at the door end (the triangular tip). Drag this handle in a circle to rotate the container. Releasing auto-saves.

            ### Clearing a Placement

            Click **Clear placement** on a placed card and confirm the prompt. The container returns to the Unplaced list and its polygon is removed from the map.

            ### Locating a Placed Container

            Click the pin icon on a placed card to fly the map to that container's position.

            ### Measure Tool

            Click the **Measure** button (ruler icon) to enter measurement mode, then click two points on the map to record a distance. Measure mode exits automatically once a measurement is recorded — click **Measure** again to add another. **Right-click** an existing measurement to delete it. Use the trash button next to **Measure** to clear all measurements at once.

            ### Who Can Edit What

            - **Map Admins** — can place and move any container at any time
            - **Barrio leads** — can place and move their barrio's containers while placement is **open**

            ## Barrio Placement Map

            The barrio placement map is the interactive editor where camp leads draw their barrio's footprint on the festival site. Each camp gets one polygon per year.

            ### Placement Phase

            Editing is controlled by the **placement phase**, opened and closed by a Map Admin. Barrio leads can only draw or edit their own polygon while the phase is **open**. Map Admins can edit any polygon at any time.

            The Admin panel can schedule the phase to open and close automatically on specific dates.

            ### Drawing Your Barrio

            1. Wait for placement to open (or check the schedule shown on the map)
            2. Click **Add my barrio** — the map enters draw mode
            3. Click points to trace the outline of your camp's footprint
            4. Click **Save** to commit, or **Cancel** to discard

            Only the **Barrio Lead** of a camp can edit that camp's polygon.

            ### Editing an Existing Polygon

            Click your barrio's polygon on the map. A popup appears with an **Edit** button (visible when placement is open or you are a Map Admin). Click it to enter edit mode — drag vertices to reshape, or drag an edge midpoint to add a new vertex. Click **Save** to commit.

            ### Polygon History

            Every save is recorded in an append-only history. Click **History** in the polygon popup to browse past versions. Map Admins can restore a previous version — restoring writes the current polygon to history before overwriting, so nothing is ever lost.

            ### Measure Tool

            Click the **Measure** button (ruler icon) to enter measurement mode, then click two points on the map to record a distance. Measure mode exits automatically once a measurement is recorded — click **Measure** again to add another. **Right-click** an existing measurement to delete it. Use the trash button next to **Measure** to clear all measurements at once. Entering measure mode exits edit mode if active.

            ### For Map Admins

            **Map Admin** is not a standalone role. You are a Map Admin if you hold the `CampAdmin` role **or** belong to the `city-planning` team. Map Admins can edit any polygon at any time (regardless of placement phase), open/close placement, upload overlays, and export GeoJSON.

            The Admin panel provides:

            - **Placement phase** — open/close now, or schedule dates
            - **Limit zone** — upload a GeoJSON outline of the site boundary (for visual reference)
            - **Official zones** — upload a GeoJSON layer of pre-defined zones (for visual reference)
            - **Containers** — create and manage shipping containers for each barrio
            - **Export** — download the year's polygons as a GeoJSON file

            ### What Happens Automatically

            - Every polygon save writes a history entry for audit
            - Every save broadcasts a real-time update to all connected humans via SignalR
